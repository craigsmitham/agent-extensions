# Evaluation boundaries

| Practice | Primary question | Relationship to evaluation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Test | Did one assertion hold? | A test may be a deterministic grader inside an evaluation. |
| Verification | Does this exact artifact or change satisfy an accepted contract? | Uses bounded conformance evidence rather than estimating a behavior distribution. |
| Benchmark | How do targets compare on a standardized suite? | A reusable evaluation whose comparability can outweigh local fit. |
| Metric | What quantity was observed? | One instrument or output, not the complete evaluation. |
| Red teaming | What consequential failure can an adversary discover? | Discovery activity; confirmed failures should become repeatable cases. |
| Monitoring | What is happening in production? | Supplies field evidence and drift signals, often without controlled ground truth. |
| A/B experiment | Which deployed variant changes real outcomes? | Controlled field comparison with user exposure and statistical obligations. |
| Audit | Is evidence, process, trust, or conformance independently supportable? | Reviews the target or the evaluation rather than merely running its suite. |

OpenAI distinguishes industry benchmarks, numerical metrics, and application-
specific evaluations.[^openai-evals] Anthropic treats automated evals,
production monitoring, user feedback, experiments, and human review as
complementary layers rather than substitutes.[^anthropic-evals]

Do not use `eval` as a synonym for every quality activity. Name the decision,
the target, and the evidence-producing method.
