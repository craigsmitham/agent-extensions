# Agents, workflows, and automation

The useful boundary is **who chooses the next meaningful step**. Anthropic
defines workflows as systems whose model and tools follow predefined code
paths, and agents as systems whose model dynamically directs the process and
tool use.[^anthropic-agents]

| Form | Primary control | Best fit |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Deterministic automation | Code or rules | Stable inputs, known transformations, strict predictability |
| LLM workflow | Predefined graph with model-valued steps | Classification, extraction, generation, or judgment inside a known process |
| Agent | Model-directed loop inside hard boundaries | Open-ended paths, changing evidence, tool choice, and recovery |
| Agentic workflow | Workflow outside, one or more bounded agents inside | Durable business process with locally dynamic work |

## Agency test

Use an agent only when the task benefits materially from several of these:

- the necessary path cannot be enumerated economically;
- observations change which action is appropriate;
- the system must select among capabilities or information sources;
- intermediate results require replanning;
- success depends on judgment across heterogeneous cases.

Prefer a workflow when control flow, dependencies, retries, compensation, or
approval sequence are known and should remain inspectable. Prefer deterministic
code when a model adds no necessary judgment.

## Complexity is a cost

Agency increases behavioral variance, attack surface, evaluation burden, and
the difficulty of attributing failures. Multiple agents add coordination and
consistency costs. OpenAI likewise recommends maximizing a single agent before
splitting responsibilities across several.[^openai-guide]

Do not classify a system as an agent merely because it uses an LLM, calls a
tool, runs in a graph, or has an “agent” product label. State the model-directed
decisions explicitly.
