# Roles, specialization, and topologies

Add an actor only when it owns a separable responsibility, authority boundary,
context boundary, or independent unit of work. A different persona alone is
not sufficient. Multi-agent surveys likewise distinguish individual-agent
design from mutual interaction and system evolution.[^multi-agent-survey]

| Topology | Use when | Main risk |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Manager or supervisor with workers | One actor can decompose, dispatch, and reconcile separable work | Bottleneck, bad decomposition, unverified synthesis |
| Handoffs among specialists | Responsibility should transfer with the task state | Lost accountability or context |
| Sequential specialists | Outputs have clear dependency order | Error propagation and latency |
| Parallel workers | Work is independent and results can be reconciled | Duplication, conflict, cost explosion |
| Peer coordination | No stable central authority fits | Deadlock, inconsistent state, diffuse responsibility |
| Hierarchy | Scale or domain structure requires nested coordination | Cascading errors and poor observability |

Anthropic's research system uses an orchestrator-worker pattern for breadth and
parallel search, while reporting coordination, token use, and evaluation as
significant engineering concerns.[^anthropic-multi-agent] OpenAI distinguishes
manager-style agents-as-tools from decentralized handoffs.[^openai-orchestration]

Choose the smallest topology that creates a measurable advantage over one
agent with tools. Define which actor owns the final result, which may commit
effects, and how conflicting outputs are reconciled.
