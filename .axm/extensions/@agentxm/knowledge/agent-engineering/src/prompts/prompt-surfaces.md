# Prompt surfaces

Prompt engineering applies anywhere authored language steers a model. Each
surface specializes the same contract while retaining a different owner.

| Surface | Prompt concern | Neighboring owner |
| --- | --- | --- |
| System or developer instruction | Stable role, priorities, invariants, authority, response defaults | Host and harness determine precedence and injection |
| Task or stored prompt | One goal, inputs, constraints, success, and output | Caller owns task authority and variable values |
| Tool name and description | Distinct purpose, selection boundary, parameter semantics, result and error use | Tool implementation and policy remain harness concerns |
| Grader prompt | Observable rubric, scale anchors, evidence use, and uncertainty | Evaluation system owns sampling, calibration, and aggregation |
| Agent handoff | Completed work, current state, unresolved questions, authority, and next outcome | Orchestrator owns actor selection and state transfer |
| Generated prompt | Meta-prompt input contract and validation of the generated artifact | Generator workflow owns review and rollout |
| Multimodal prompt | Explicit reference to each modality and its role | Host owns encoding, limits, and supported modalities |

Anthropic reports that tool descriptions and specifications materially steer
tool choice and parameter use, and recommends testing them with the same rigor
as other prompts.[^anthropic-tools] A grader prompt is also a prompt; its output
must be calibrated rather than treated as objective merely because it returns a
score.[^anthropic-evals]

Google recommends treating text, images, audio, and video as equal-class inputs
whose relationships are stated explicitly.[^google-prompting] Keep modality-
specific syntax in current host documentation rather than freezing it into a
portable rule.
