# Workflow contracts

An activated skill must tell an agent how to act, decide, recover, and know it
is finished. A bag of advice can improve prose yet still fail as a workflow.

## Contract checklist

| Contract | Required questions |
| --- | --- |
| Start | Which event, request, or artifact begins the job? |
| Inputs | What may the caller supply, and what must the agent discover? |
| Preconditions | Which state, evidence, tools, or permissions must exist? |
| Sequence | Which steps depend on earlier evidence or state? |
| Judgment | Which choices require context, policy, or human acceptance? |
| Authority | Which reads, writes, commands, external actions, and escalations are allowed? |
| Failures | Which conditions retry, degrade, stop, or request help? |
| Output | Which artifact, action, or decision is returned? |
| Presentation | Which fields, labels, relative order, repetition, and visual weight are contractual? |
| Completion | What objective evidence shows the outcome exists? |
| Non-goals | Which adjacent work remains elsewhere? |

## Instruction shape

- Use imperative steps in execution order.
- Name the evidence each material step consumes and produces.
- Branch only where a real decision changes action.
- State destructive or externally mutable behavior before the action.
- Require confirmation when authority cannot be derived from the request.
- End with verification proportional to the consequence of failure.

Avoid aspirations such as “ensure quality” without an observer, condition, or
check. Avoid rigid steps where the task legitimately admits several approaches.

## Presentation contracts

Semantic completeness does not imply a stable interaction. When placement or
order changes interpretation, authority, comparison, or downstream use, specify
the presentation separately from the content:

- name required sections and their relative order;
- state which sections are optional and what permits omission or compression;
- require parallel fields and comparable emphasis where alternatives must be
  weighed fairly;
- state whether an item may appear more than once; and
- name the final prompt, handoff, or status the interaction must end with.

Keep one authoritative shape at the step that emits it. Use a strict template
for a measured consistency requirement; do not scatter equivalent rules across
prose and examples.
