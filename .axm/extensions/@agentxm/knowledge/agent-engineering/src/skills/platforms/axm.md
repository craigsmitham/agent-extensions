# AXM extension-management profile

AXM is an extension manager and distribution layer, not an agent host. Apply
this profile whenever AXM owns a package, alongside the portable contract for
the extension type and the profile for every host the extension supports.

## Managed extension model

AXM manages skills, subagents, MCP servers, rules, hooks, Knowledge bundles, and
packs. Each authored package stays canonical under
`.axm/extensions/<owner>/<plural-type>/<name>/`; agent-native files and config
are projections, not authoring sources.[^axm-skills-architecture] A skill
combines portable `src/SKILL.md` content with `skill.json` distribution
metadata, while the other types use their own portable payload and manifest
contracts.[^axm-skills-help]

Keep these state families distinct:[^axm-workspace-state-help]

| State | Authority |
| --- | --- |
| Desired | `.axm/settings.json` and workspace-authored pack manifests |
| Accepted resolution | Immutable external identities in `.axm/axm-lock.yaml` |
| Observed | Canonical packages, projections, managed regions, and ownership markers |

Use AXM commands or desired-state sources to change intent. Use `axm lint` for
read-only facts and `axm sync --preview` before reconciliation. Never reconstruct
intent from a lock row, hand-edit an agent projection, or treat a copied native
file as canonical.

## Composition and package relationships

Keep an extension self-contained unless required coupling is declared through
one pack. Every required sibling must be a direct member of that pack; the
referencing extension must be non-standalone, recommend the pack, and use the
canonical same-pack path. Pack install, update, enable, disable, uninstall, and
unpack apply to the complete member graph atomically.[^axm-packs-help]

`recommendedPacks` is discovery metadata, not an installation guarantee. A
host-native agent plugin is not an AXM extension type and is not interchangeable
with an AXM pack. Link ecosystem or plugin packages to extensions through AXM's
companion-package and recommended-extension metadata; when several extensions
belong together, recommend one pack rather than parallel entries.[^axm-package-extensions-help]

## Lifecycle controls

Governance states and AXM operations answer different questions. A governance
decision can require several AXM actions:

| Intent | AXM control |
| --- | --- |
| Record migration guidance | `axm deprecate` |
| Exclude one or all versions from fresh resolution | `axm yank` |
| Retain an installed extension but deactivate it | Type-specific `disable` |
| Remove an extension from one workspace | `axm uninstall` |
| Change an authored package version | `axm version` |
| Reconcile accepted intent and owned projections | `axm sync` |

Deprecation is warning-only: it does not block fresh resolution or deactivate
existing installations. Yanking changes fresh resolution without deleting the
published identity. Disabling preserves managed canonical and resolution state;
uninstalling removes only state no remaining direct or pack origin requires.
Treat AXM's desired and listed `enabled` state as activation authority; retained
canonical source or a surviving projection is not evidence that a disabled
extension may be invoked. Do not translate `deprecated`, `revoked`, or
`retired` into one guessed command.

## Authoring and verification

Use the CLI's current help before mutations, preview changes, lint the workspace,
review generated state, use `axm packs show` for composition, and verify package
integrity before publishing. Keep portable behavior in the extension payload and
AXM distribution metadata in the manifest. AXM behavior is versioned; this
profile was checked against AXM 0.27.15 and must be refreshed against the
current CLI and schemas after its `stale_after` date.
