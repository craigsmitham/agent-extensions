# AXM skill profile

AXM workspaces keep authored skill content under a canonical extension package
and project it into host discovery locations. Author through AXM and edit the
canonical `src/` content, never a generated agent-specific projection. Current
CLI behavior and schemas are documented by AXM.[^axm-skills-architecture]

An AXM skill package combines the portable `src/SKILL.md` tree with `skill.json`
for registry metadata such as version, human description, license, repository,
keywords, standalone status, and recommended packs. Portable frontmatter belongs
in `SKILL.md`; distribution metadata belongs in the manifest.[^axm-skills-help]

Cross-extension references require an intentional pack: every referenced
extension must be a direct dependency, the referencing skill must be non-
standalone and recommend that pack, and paths must use AXM's canonical extension
layout. Projection paths and shared local installation state are not dependency
contracts.[^axm-skills-help]

Use the CLI's current help before mutations, preview changes, lint the workspace,
review generated state, and verify pack dependencies and integrity before
publishing. AXM behavior is versioned; this profile was checked against AXM
0.27.5 and must be refreshed against the current CLI and schema after its
`stale_after` date.
