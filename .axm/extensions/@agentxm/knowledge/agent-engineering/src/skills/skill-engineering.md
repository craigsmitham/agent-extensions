# Skill engineering

**Skill engineering** is the practice of turning reusable agent behavior into
discoverable, executable, evaluated, secure, portable, and maintainable
artifacts. The open Agent Skills format supplies a small portable container:
metadata and instructions in `SKILL.md`, plus optional scripts, references, and
assets.[^agent-skills-spec] Engineering owns the decisions that syntax leaves
open.

## Why syntax is insufficient

A valid package can still fail because it:

- never activates or activates for adjacent work;
- explains a topic without defining an executable workflow;
- hides tools, permissions, dependencies, or side effects;
- works once but regresses across paraphrases, models, or hosts;
- contains unsafe code, deceptive metadata, or untrusted dependencies; or
- remains installed after its workflow, environment, or evidence becomes stale.

Skills therefore resemble small software products more than disposable
prompts. They have contracts, dependencies, tests, releases, trust boundaries,
consumers, and a retirement point.

## The lifecycle

```text
observe -> select -> design -> author -> validate -> evaluate -> distribute
   ^                                                           |
   +--------------- maintain, evolve, or retire ----------------+
```

Recent lifecycle research likewise treats skill libraries as evolving stores
with admission, retrieval, verification, maintenance, provenance, and rollback
rather than static prompt collections.[^dynamic-agent-skills]

## Scope

Skill engineering owns an individual skill's routing, workflow, capabilities,
outcomes, trust, compatibility, and behavioral lifecycle. It also owns
portfolio decisions that emerge from many skills: admission, ownership,
capability governance, collision, utility, composition intent, version intent,
and retirement criteria.

It does not own the whole harness, an agent's identity and tool policy, an MCP
server's implementation, an extension manager's package and projection state,
a plugin distribution system, or repository-wide instructions. Those surfaces
constrain skills and must be observed, but they remain separate authorities.
