# Graders, rubrics, and metrics

Use the least subjective instrument that can observe the contract:

| Instrument | Best use | Main risk |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Deterministic check | Schema, tests, tool arguments, external state, limits, forbidden effects | Brittleness to valid alternatives |
| Reference-based check | Bounded facts or expected components | Incomplete or stale references |
| Model grader | Open-ended quality, grounded rubrics, pairwise discrimination | Nondeterminism and systematic bias |
| Human grader | Consequential, novel, preference-sensitive, or calibration work | Cost, delay, and reviewer disagreement |

Define graders before inspecting candidate outputs. Keep critical dimensions
separate, give partial credit only where it represents meaningful partial
success, and provide `unknown` when evidence is insufficient. Anthropic
recommends deterministic grading where possible and human-calibrated model
graders where interpretation is necessary.[^anthropic-evals]

Treat a model grader as a measurement instrument:

- use a narrow rubric with observable anchors;
- calibrate against reviewed examples and measure disagreements;
- record model, prompt, context, sampling, and rubric versions;
- swap comparison order and test irrelevant style variation;
- avoid having one opaque score hide safety or authority failures; and
- periodically regrade a stable calibration set.

Published research reports position, verbosity, self-preference, and reasoning
limitations in LLM judges.[^llm-judge] A grader must earn trust; fluent
explanations do not establish validity.
