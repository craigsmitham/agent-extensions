# Evaluation contracts

Define the contract before running candidates:

| Field | Required question |
| --- | --- |
| Decision | Which selection, release, diagnosis, admission, rollback, or retirement will this inform? |
| Target | Which exact model, prompt, context, tools, harness, skill, configuration, and revision are evaluated? |
| Scope | Which users, tasks, conditions, risks, and exclusions matter? |
| Unit | Is judgment attached to a response, action, trajectory, outcome, trial, task, cohort, or complete suite? |
| Cases | Which distribution, sampling method, fixtures, and held-out boundaries apply? |
| Environment | Which state, authority, time, dependencies, and isolation conditions apply? |
| Evidence | Which traces, outputs, artifacts, external state, costs, and incidents are captured? |
| Grading | Which grader versions, rubrics, metrics, calibration evidence, and unknown states apply? |
| Trials | How many independent attempts are required, and why? |
| Comparison | Which baseline or alternative makes the result meaningful? |
| Analysis | Which aggregation, thresholds, slices, uncertainty, and failure taxonomy apply? |
| Provenance | Who authored, ran, reviewed, and owns the evaluation, and when does evidence expire? |

NIST requires documented test sets, tools, metrics, deployment-like conditions,
uncertainty, and limitations on generalization.[^nist-rmf] Record missing or
untestable fields instead of silently narrowing the claim.
