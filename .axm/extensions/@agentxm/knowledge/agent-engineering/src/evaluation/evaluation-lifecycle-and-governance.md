# Evaluation lifecycle and governance

Treat each suite as an owned product:

- version tasks, fixtures, environments, harnesses, graders, rubrics, and
  analysis rules independently;
- bind every report to the exact evaluated target and evaluation identity;
- preserve raw evidence or durable locators subject to privacy and security;
- separate author claims, evaluation results, independent review, and the
  final management decision;
- assign owners for infrastructure while enabling domain and product experts
  to contribute cases;
- set review triggers for target, model, host, environment, grader, population,
  risk, or policy changes;
- track ambiguity, broken cases, saturation, leakage, and unresolved claims;
- deprecate superseded suites and retain decision provenance; and
- retire measurements that no longer supply unique decision value.

Anthropic calls evaluation suites living artifacts needing clear ownership and
ongoing contribution.[^anthropic-evals] NIST requires documented roles,
methods, results, independent review, and evaluation of measurement efficacy.[^nist-rmf]

Keep durable knowledge independent of one provider API. OpenAI's current Evals
platform is scheduled for shutdown in 2026, illustrating why tool instructions
should remain profiles rather than the core method.[^openai-evals]
