# Context engineering boundary

Context engineering shapes the informational environment an agent receives,
discovers, produces, and carries through a task. It owns selection, authority,
routing, retrieval, memory, compaction, and information lifecycle.[^anthropic-context-engineering]

It is one responsibility within harness engineering, not a synonym for the
whole harness. Context can help an agent decide, but it does not provision an
execution environment, enforce a permission boundary, execute an effect, or
prove that an external outcome occurred.[^openai-harness-engineering]

Prompt engineering is narrower still: it designs model-facing instructions and
inputs at particular interaction surfaces. A harness decides when and how those
prompts are composed alongside tools, state, runtime, feedback, and controls.

Use the context-engineering discipline for detailed context decisions. Use
harness engineering when the question crosses information, execution,
interfaces, authority, and evidence.
