# Instruction structure and examples

Structure makes distinctions visible; it does not compensate for an undefined
contract. Use headings, tags, or other consistent delimiters when they help the
model distinguish task, instructions, examples, variable data, and output.

## Choose the right specificity

| Too little | Useful middle | Too much |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Vague aspiration or assumed shared context | Concrete goal, constraints, criteria, and bounded heuristics | Brittle pseudo-code for every possible case |

Anthropic recommends clear, direct prompts at an altitude between vague
guidance and hard-coded procedural logic.[^anthropic-context] State each rule
once, keep the smallest sufficient set, and add detail in response to measured
failures rather than imagined edge cases.[^openai-guidance]

## Use examples as evidence-bearing instructions

Examples are valuable when they demonstrate judgment, boundary cases, tone, or
a response shape more clearly than prose. They should be:

- representative of the claimed input distribution;
- diverse enough not to teach an incidental shortcut;
- internally consistent in labels, whitespace, and field order;
- explicit about the property being demonstrated; and
- paired with negative or edge behavior when the boundary matters.

Google notes that few-shot examples steer format, phrasing, scope, and broader
patterns, while too many examples can overfit behavior to the demonstrations.[^google-prompting]

Examples do not override contradictory instructions. When prose and examples
disagree, repair the contract instead of adding another example.

## Treat order as a variable

Prompt content order can change output. Place critical behavioral constraints
where the host gives them appropriate authority, keep related sections
together, and test alternate order when a material failure may be positional.
Do not elevate data merely by placing it near higher-authority instructions.
