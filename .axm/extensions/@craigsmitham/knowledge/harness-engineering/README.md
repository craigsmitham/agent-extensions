# Harness engineering knowledge

Portable knowledge for designing, evaluating, and maintaining the system
around an agent: runtime, interfaces, state, feedback, authority, containment,
and operating environment. It implements and enforces an agent's behavioral
contract; it does not own agency choice, goals, planning, capability policy,
memory influence, delegation, recovery choice, or stopping behavior. Context
is one harness input, but its detailed selection, routing, memory, and lifecycle
practices belong to context engineering.

Begin with harness engineering, agent-system composition, and classification,
then inspect agent legibility and the concrete system responsibilities under
harness elements. Domain and environment profiles apply those foundations to
recognizable work and ownership boundaries, including coding harnesses and
repository harnesses.

For agent behavior, context surfaces, prompts, and Agent Skills, this bundle
owns only the implementation boundary within the whole system. Their detailed
design and lifecycle belong to their respective engineering disciplines. The
knowledge bundle is independently installable.

## Install

```bash
axm install @craigsmitham/knowledge/harness-engineering
```

## Usage

Browse from the bundle index or open a concept directly:

```bash

axm knowledge open harness-engineering foundations/harness-classification
axm knowledge open harness-engineering foundations/agent-legibility
axm knowledge open harness-engineering elements/action-and-observation-interfaces
axm knowledge open harness-engineering elements/runtime-and-environments
axm knowledge open harness-engineering elements/feedback-and-verification
axm knowledge open harness-engineering elements/authority-and-containment
axm knowledge open harness-engineering domains/software-engineering/harnesses

```

The bundle was migrated from the original `@agentxm` package while preserving
its content provenance.

Stable concepts record machine generation and verification events in OKF
frontmatter. Machine confirmation does not claim human review.
