# Workflow model

Vendor terms such as *pipeline*, *workflow*, *stage*, *job*, *task*, *action*,
and *step* do not form one portable hierarchy. Buildkite configuration steps
become runtime jobs, while Cloudflare workflow steps may run concurrently in
isolated sandboxes with their own retry and timeout behavior.[^buildkite-steps][^cloudflare-ci]
The model therefore separates definition from runtime and treats vendor nouns
as mappings onto semantic roles and properties.

## Definition plane

| Object | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **Workflow definition** | Versioned automation specification: intended outcome, topology, logic, defaults, and policy references |
| **Component** | Reusable workflow, task, action, template, command, or other callable definition |
| **Work-unit definition** | Addressable node in the workflow graph, possibly containing other work units |

## Runtime plane

| Object | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **Invocation** | Request to execute: trigger, actor, time, inputs, subject revision, and reason |
| **Workflow run** | One execution of a workflow definition |
| **Work-unit run** | Runtime realization of one work-unit definition within a workflow run |
| **Attempt** | One try of a workflow or work-unit run; retry creates another attempt rather than changing what the unit means |
| **Executor** | Agent, runner, worker, machine, pod, container, sandbox, or managed service performing work |

## Context plane

| Object | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **Data object** | Input, output, result, artifact, cache entry, workspace, checkpoint, or other information carried or preserved |
| **Target** | Environment, service, repository, registry, infrastructure resource, or other system observed or affected |

The split matters operationally. A work-unit definition may be reused many
times; a work-unit run has a particular status and timing; an attempt explains
retry cost and history; an executor explains queueing, isolation, and resource
behavior.

## Work-unit roles

A work unit is recursive and has one primary role:

* **Group** — organizes work or establishes a policy boundary, such as a phase
  or stage.
* **Task** — performs computation or causes an effect.
* **Gate** — waits, approves, evaluates, or controls progression.
* **Call** — invokes another workflow or reusable component.

Treat something as a work unit when the platform gives it addressable behavior:
identity, status, timing, dependency, retry, timeout, logs, or policy. Commands
that appear only inside an undivided log can remain implementation detail.

## Relationships

The model uses a small set of explicit relationships:

| Relationship | Question answered |
| --- | --- |
| **contains** | Which definition or group owns this work? |
| **depends on** | What must be satisfied before this work may proceed? |
| **passes data to** | Which information crosses a work boundary? |
| **runs on** | Which executor performs this run or attempt? |
| **triggered by** | Which event, actor, schedule, or parent caused this run? |
| **affects** | Which target is read, changed, promoted, or reconciled? |

Containment is not execution order. Order and concurrency come from dependency
and condition relationships. Likewise, data availability should not be assumed
merely because two units are visually adjacent.

## Behavioral properties

Do not infer behavior from a platform label. Record these properties on the
relevant workflow or work unit:

* scheduling, queueing, priority, and supersession
* dependency, condition, concurrency, and cancellation
* executor selection, isolation, workspace, and resource allocation
* timeout, retry, backoff, idempotency, and resumption
* inputs, outputs, side effects, artifacts, caches, and checkpoints
* permissions, secrets, approvals, and trust boundaries
* status, timing, logs, test results, provenance, and control surfaces

A platform may allocate an executor at what it calls a job, task, step, or
action. Retry may occur at a different boundary from scheduling. Those are
properties of the mapped object, not universal definitions of the noun.

## Platform mappings

| Platform | Mapping to this model |
| --- | --- |
| GitHub Actions[^github-actions] | Workflow → definition; workflow run → run; job → composite work unit with runner allocation; step → nested task; runner → executor |
| GitLab CI/CD[^gitlab-pipelines] | Configuration → definition; pipeline → run; stage → group; job → independently run task; runner → executor; script commands are usually below the first-class model |
| Azure Pipelines[^azure-concepts] | Pipeline → definition; pipeline run → run; stage → group; job → execution boundary; step/task/script → nested task; agent → executor |
| CircleCI[^circleci-concepts] | Pipeline and workflow definitions form nested orchestration; triggered pipeline/workflow → runs; job → composite work unit; step → nested task; executor → executor |
| Buildkite[^buildkite-steps] | Pipeline → definition; build → run; configured command step → work-unit definition; generated job → work-unit run; agent → executor |
| Jenkins[^jenkins-pipeline] | Pipeline → definition; build → run; stage → group; Pipeline step → work unit; agent/node/executor allocation → executor context |
| Tekton[^tekton-overview] | Pipeline → definition; PipelineRun → run; Task → reusable composite work unit; TaskRun → work-unit run; Step → nested task; Kubernetes Pod → executor boundary |
| Argo Workflows[^argo-concepts] | Workflow object combines definition and live run state; template → component; DAG task or steps entry → work unit; pod/container → executor |
| AWS CodePipeline[^aws-codepipeline] | Pipeline → definition; pipeline execution → run; stage → group; action → task or gate; action provider → executor/service; artifact → data object |
| Google Cloud Build[^google-cloud-build] | Build configuration → definition; build → run; build step → work unit executed in a container; worker pool/managed infrastructure → executor context |
| Cloudflare Workflows and CI[^cloudflare-ci] | Workflow → definition; instance → run (also described as the CI job); `runner()` or `step.do()` → work unit; Sandbox/Workers runtime → executor; snapshot → data object |

## Limits of the model

This is a comparison model, not a lowest-common-denominator execution
specification. It intentionally preserves platform-specific distinctions as
properties and notes rather than pretending that all jobs or steps behave the
same. A mapping should be revised when it hides a consequential scheduling,
isolation, data, policy, or observability boundary.
