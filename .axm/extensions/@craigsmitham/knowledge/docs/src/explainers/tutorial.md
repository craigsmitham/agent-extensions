# Tutorial explainer

A **tutorial** is a **lesson** — an **experience** under the guidance of a
tutor. It is always **learning-oriented**: the user *does* something
meaningful toward an achievable goal so they can **acquire** skill, not so
they can finish a production task.

The obligation is a **successful learning experience**. What the learner
*does* is not always what they *learn*; through action they pick up names,
tools, workflows, confidence, and how things relate.

Teaching a child to cook is a strong everyday model: success is what the
child gains and whether they want to return to the kitchen — not culinary
perfection or a complete dish every time.

To write one, use [Tutorial guide](../guides/tutorial.md).

## Place on the map

In Diátaxis, tutorial sits with **action** (what the user does) and **study**
(acquisition of skill):

| Axis | Tutorial’s side | Contrast |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Action vs cognition | Action / practical steps | Reference and explanation inform what the user *knows* |
| Study vs work | Study (learn under guidance) | How-to also directs action, but for **work** — a real goal |

So tutorial and how-to both sequence steps, yet they answer different needs:
learning vs doing. Conflating them is the most common failure in product
docs.

Its vantage is the **managed lesson**: the teacher sets the path, tools, and
encounters. The unit is a **learning journey**, not a human production goal
and not an inventory of the machinery.

## Orientation

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **Reader need** | Learning / acquisition of skill |
| **Success** | Confidence and familiarity; a completed path that worked; desire to return and practice |
| **Voice** | Tutor leading a lesson — we are in this together; not a manual listing options |
| **Typical prompt** | *Can you teach me to…?* · *Help me get my first success with…* |
| **Title cue** | Often *Getting started…*, *Your first…*, or *In this tutorial we will…* — a lesson frame, not *How to* production work |

## Contract of the lesson

Nearly all responsibility falls on the **teacher** (the document author):
what will be learned, what the pupil will do, and the pupil’s success. The
pupil’s duty is attention and following directions — not already knowing, and
not owning production risk.

The exercise must be:

- **meaningful** — a sense of achievement
- **successful** — completable by the intended learner
- **logical** — the path makes sense
- **usefully complete** — encounter with the actions, concepts, and tools
  that matter for this lesson

In written docs the tutor is **present in text but absent in person** — so
the path must aspire to work every time; observation and testing find the
gaps a live teacher would catch.

## What belongs

- A clear picture of **where the learner will be going** (*In this tutorial
  we will create… Along the way we will encounter…*) — not the presumptuous
  *you will learn…*
- **Concrete actions** in a managed, often single-line path; small steps;
  **visible results early and often**
- A **narrative of the expected** — what output should look like; likely
  signs of going wrong; preparation for surprising volume of output
- Prompts to **notice** the environment (close the learning loop)
- **Minimal** in-path explanation (*We’re using HTTPS because it’s more
  secure*) with links out for depth
- Room for **repetition** of successful steps where reversible
- Enough scene-setting to start; cut optional branches and catalogs

## What does not belong

- Extended **explanation** mid-lesson — it breaks learning focus; link
  instead
- **Choices and alternatives** that dilute the path to conclusion
- Exhaustive options, edge cases, and configuration **catalogs** (reference)
- Production troubleshooting for arbitrary real goals (how-to)
- Abstraction and generalisation as the teaching method — learning moves
  from concrete particular toward general patterns
- A production how-to labeled “tutorial,” or a tutorial that pretends to be
  the full product manual

## Quality signals

- A suitable beginner can complete it without inventing missing steps
- Every step serves the learning path; dead ends are rare
- Results are visible and meaningful along the way
- Failure modes that routinely block *this* lesson are handled or avoided
- Explanation and option lists appear as **links**, not bulk digressions
- After finishing, the learner has **confidence and familiarity** — not only
  a shipped production outcome or a scanned catalog

## Language that fits tutorials

Useful shapes (paraphrased from Diátaxis):

- *We…* / *In this tutorial, we will…* (shared journey; name the accomplishment)
- *First, do x. Now, do y. Now that you have done y, do z.* (no ambiguity)
- *We must always do x before y because… (see Explanation for more details).*
  (minimal *why*; link out)
- *The output should look something like…*
- *Notice that… Remember that… Let’s check…*
- *You have built a…* (mildly admire what they accomplished)

## Tutorial vs how-to (the hard boundary)

Both are practical sequences of steps. The difference is **need**, not
basic-vs-advanced:

| | Tutorial | How-to |
| --- | --- | --- |
| User mode | Study — acquire skill | Work — apply skill |
| Purpose | Successful learning experience | Correct task completion |
| Path | Managed, often single line; eliminate surprise | Real world; prepare for the unexpected |
| Safety | Must be safe to retry under the “teacher” | Cannot always promise safety; user owns risk |
| Choices | Few or none mid-path | Forks and alternatives common |
| Generality | One concrete, particular experience that builds transferable skill | Addresses a particular task, but framed to adapt across the varying real conditions readers bring |
| Competence | May lack even the right questions | Assumed to ask the right question |

A clinical training pad (lesson) vs a surgical procedure manual (work) is the
same distinction as a sandboxed “first project” vs “deploy blue-green with
rollback.”

## Failure modes (common)

- **Tutorial/how-to conflation** — production guidance labeled as a lesson,
  or a lesson that pretends to be a runbook
- **Teaching by explaining** — long theory mid-path that dissolves attention
  instead of *doing*
- **Choice overload** — every option and alternative on the first path
- **No early success** — long setup before any meaningful result
- **Unreliable path** — steps that often fail; confidence collapses
- **Basic/advanced confusion** — treating tutorials as “simple only”;
  advanced lessons still follow the same study contract
