# Structured concurrency

Every child fiber should have an owner, a failure policy, and a shutdown path.

**Applies when** code uses detached promises, `Promise.all`, `AbortController`,
manual races, orphanable background tasks, or unbounded parallelism — even
without existing fibers.

**Leave alone** sequential work, and intentionally external jobs whose lifetime
is owned by another system.

Related: [Iteration](iteration.md) for choosing the traversal primitive and its
concurrency bound, [Resource safety](resource-safety.md) for scoped cleanup and
uninterruptible regions, [Async coordination](async-coordination.md) for
coordination primitives such as Semaphore.

## Prefer structured operations

- Use `Effect.all`, `forEach`, racing, timeout, and other high-level
  combinators when the parent should await a result; the combinator owns and
  interrupts the child fibers.[^src-effect]
- Decide whether the first failure interrupts siblings or whether every
  outcome is collected as data — `Effect.all` with `mode: "result"` and
  `Effect.partition` run every effect and return outcomes as values. Preserve
  every failure the contract requires.[^src-effect]
- Expect losing race branches and timed-out work to be interrupted. Use
  race/timeout only when losing work may be interrupted safely; a foreign
  adapter must accept cancellation or clearly state that interruption only
  stops waiting.[^src-effect] [^applied-effect-local]
- Preserve input/output ordering only when required, because it can constrain
  streaming or completion behavior.
- Which traversal primitive to use, what concurrency bound to set, and when a
  shared Semaphore replaces a per-traversal bound are owned by
  [Iteration](iteration.md).

## Fork with a lifetime

- Use `forkChild` for work supervised by the parent and `forkScoped` for work
  owned by the current scope, which adds `Scope` to the requirements and
  interrupts the fiber when the scope closes.[^src-effect] [^docs-run-main]
- Use `forkIn` only when an explicit scope is the real owner.
- Treat `forkDetach` as an exceptional daemon choice. Document who observes
  failure and stops it.[^src-effect]
- Join, interrupt, or otherwise observe fibers whose outcome matters. Pipe a
  background loop's failure cause into logging or supervision; a daemon with
  no failure observer is lost work.[^applied-dfx]

## Own dynamic fibers

When fibers start in response to runtime events rather than at composition
time, keep them in a scoped container instead of loose forks:

- `FiberSet` owns a collection of worker fibers: completed fibers remove
  themselves, and closing the scope interrupts the rest.[^src-fiberset]
- `FiberMap` owns keyed per-entity fibers: running a new fiber under an
  existing key replaces the previous one, and scope close interrupts them
  all.[^src-fibermap]
- `FiberHandle` owns a single replaceable background fiber — running a new
  fiber interrupts the current one unless `onlyIfMissing` is set — the right
  shape for reconnect or refresh loops.[^src-fiberhandle] [^applied-dfx]
- Use the module's `makeRuntime` when a non-Effect callback must spawn fibers
  that remain owned by the scope.[^applied-opencode]

## Keep cancellation sound

- Keep blocking or callback adapters cancellation-aware so interruption
  reaches the actual work, not just the waiting fiber.
- An interrupted child must still release what it acquired; scoped
  acquisition, finalizers, and uninterruptible-region policy are owned by
  [Resource safety](resource-safety.md).
- Avoid fire-and-forget effects and accidental fan-out over unbounded inputs.

## Supervise shutdown

- On shutdown, stop admitting work, signal owned producers, await the accepted
  drain window, then interrupt remaining child fibers and release resources.
- Acquire listeners, queues, workers, and connections in scopes the graph
  owns, so parent interruption cannot leak them.
- Observe every detached fiber's failure through supervision or explicit
  logging.

## Review checklist

- Parent, scope, or explicit supervisor owns every child fiber, including
  dynamically spawned ones.
- Sibling failure, result accumulation, ordering, and race-loss behavior are
  explicit.
- Cancellation reaches adapters, and interrupted children release scoped
  resources.
- Every background or detached fiber has a failure observer.
- Shutdown has a defined admission, drain, interrupt, and observation
  sequence.
