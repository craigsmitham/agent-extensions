# SQL

Reach a relational database through one client service, one error type, and a
transaction boundary you place on purpose.

**Applies when** wiring a database client, composing statements, deciding what
a driver failure means to callers, adapting rows into domain values, or fixing
a transaction that does not cover what you thought it covered.

**Leave alone** databases with a first-class Effect integration of their own,
and query building a dialect-specific tool already owns end to end.

This guide follows the applied spine — `SqlClient` plus tagged-template
statements, with `SqlSchema` as the decode adapter — not the `Model.Class` →
`Migrator` → `SqlModel.makeRepository` spine in official docs,[^docs-sql-basics]
because the guidance here is evidence-backed and the upstream spine has no
applied evidence in the reference corpus.

Related: [Error modeling](error-modeling.md) for reason-carrying errors,
[Schema boundaries](schema-boundaries.md) for what rows decode into,
[Resource safety](resource-safety.md) for connection lifetimes,
[Cloudflare Workers](cloudflare-workers.md) for D1 and Durable Object SQLite.
Browse the module surface at the
[Effect v4 API reference](https://www.effect.website/docs/v4/api).

## Know what you are adopting

- `effect/unstable/sql` ships inside the `effect` package and carries no
  stability guarantee; pin your Effect version.[^src-sql-client]
- Nine modules exist; four carry ordinary application work — `SqlClient`,
  `Statement`, `SqlError`, `SqlSchema`. `SqlResolver` belongs to batching,
  `Migrator` to deployment, `SqlModel` to `Model.Class`, and `SqlConnection`
  and `SqlStream` to driver authors.[^src-sql-stream]
- `SqlClient` is the spine: it *is* the statement constructor, plus `reserve`,
  `withTransaction`, `transactionService`, and the reactive
  helpers.[^src-sql-client]

## Wire one client behind two tags

```ts
import { Effect } from "effect"
import { PgClient } from "@effect/sql-pg"
import { SqlClient } from "effect/unstable/sql"

// Layer<PgClient | SqlClient, SqlError>: one client, published twice.
const SqlLive = PgClient.layer({ database: "app", maxConnections: 10 })

const countUsers = Effect.gen(function*() {
  const sql = yield* SqlClient.SqlClient
  return yield* sql<{ n: number }>`SELECT count(*) AS n FROM users`
})
```

- Depend on `SqlClient.SqlClient`, not the dialect tag, so a service stays
  portable across Postgres, SQLite, and D1. Reach for the dialect tag only for
  dialect-only capability such as `D1Client.batch`.[^src-d1-client]
- Dialect `layer`/`layerConfig`/`layerFrom` constructors already publish both
  tags from a single `make`.[^src-pg-client] When you build the client
  yourself, derive the generic tag from the dialect tag rather than building
  twice — two builds mean two prepared-statement caches and, worse, two
  transaction identities.[^applied-alchemy-d1]

## Build statements

- A `Statement<A>` *is* an `Effect<ReadonlyArray<A>, SqlError>`. Yield it;
  there is no `.execute`. `.compile()` returns `[sql, params]` without
  executing — use it to inspect or guard a statement, not to run it by
  hand.[^src-statement] [^applied-effect-local-executor]
- Interpolated values become bound parameters. `sql(name)` produces a quoted
  identifier, and `sql.insert`, `sql.update`, `sql.in`, `sql.and`, `sql.or`,
  and `sql.csv` produce fragments that nest inside other templates to arbitrary
  depth.[^src-statement] [^applied-alchemy-routes]
- `sql.unsafe` and `sql.literal` splice text in verbatim: injection surfaces
  that also leak into traces
  ([query text](#keep-query-text-out-of-your-traces)). Dialect gaps are typed —
  `sql.updateValues` is unsupported on SQLite and `never` on
  D1.[^src-statement] [^src-d1-client]

## Propagate statements; classify SQL failures at owning boundaries

A statement or transaction participant should normally preserve `SqlError` in
its error channel. Handle a reason beside the statement only when that statement
owns its domain meaning, such as an expected uniqueness conflict. Translate
infrastructure failures or convert residual failures to defects once, at the
repository, service, handler, or scheduler boundary that owns their
disposition. Do not append `catchTag("SqlError", Effect.die)` to every statement
merely to narrow its local signature.[^docs-effect-tsgo]

The SQL layer surfaces exactly one tagged error, `SqlError`, whose `_tag` is
always `"SqlError"`. The discriminant sits one level deeper, in `reason`.
`Effect.catchTag("UniqueViolation", …)` does not compile.[^src-sql-error]

Eleven reasons exist. Each carries `cause`, optional `message`, and optional
`operation`; `UniqueViolation` alone adds `constraint`. `error.isRetryable`
delegates to the reason, and classification is per dialect and code-driven —
the PostgreSQL column below is the whole theory behind the retryable
column.[^src-sql-error] [^src-pg-client] [^pg-errcodes]

| Reason | `isRetryable` | PostgreSQL trigger |
|---|---|---|
| `ConnectionError` | yes | class `08*` |
| `AuthenticationError` | no | class `28*` |
| `AuthorizationError` | no | `42501` |
| `SqlSyntaxError` | no | class `42*` |
| `UniqueViolation` | no | `23505`, carrying `constraint` |
| `ConstraintError` | no | class `23*` |
| `DeadlockError` | yes | `40P01` deadlock detected |
| `SerializationError` | yes | `40001` serialization failure |
| `LockTimeoutError` | yes | `55P03` lock not available |
| `StatementTimeoutError` | yes | `57014` query canceled |
| `UnknownError` | no | anything unmatched |

- Specific codes are tested before their class (`42501` before `42*`, `23505`
  before `23*`), and anything a driver cannot place becomes `UnknownError`,
  which is *not* retryable. The flag is deliberately conservative, but it
  establishes technical eligibility rather than permission to retry. Combine
  it with idempotency, transaction scope, a bounded schedule, and a total
  timeout.[^src-sql-error] [^src-pg-client]
- Retry a serialization or deadlock failure around the complete transaction,
  including the logic that selected its statements and values — never around
  one participant inside that transaction.[^pg-serialization]
- Translate at the boundary that owns the domain meaning:
  `Effect.catchReason` for one reason, `Effect.catchReasons` for a
  partition.[^src-effect-catch-reason] Both leave `SqlError` in the channel
  with a narrowed reason, so a following `catchTag("SqlError", …)` still
  handles the residue.[^applied-effect-local-executor] [^applied-alchemy-lock]

```ts
import { Effect } from "effect"

// Data-access participant: preserve SqlError for the owning boundary.
const insertUserRow = (email: string) =>
  sql`INSERT INTO users ${sql.insert({ email })}`

// Feature boundary: own domain, availability, and residual-failure policy once.
const createUser = (email: string) =>
  insertUserRow(email).pipe(
    Effect.catchReason(
      "SqlError",
      "UniqueViolation",
      (reason, error) =>
        reason.constraint === "users_email_key"
          ? Effect.fail(new EmailTaken({ email }))
          : Effect.fail(error),
    ),
    Effect.catchReasons("SqlError", {
      ConnectionError: (_, error) =>
        Effect.fail(
          new StorageUnavailable({ operation: "create-user", cause: error }),
        ),
      DeadlockError: (_, error) =>
        Effect.fail(
          new StorageUnavailable({ operation: "create-user", cause: error }),
        ),
      SerializationError: (_, error) =>
        Effect.fail(
          new StorageUnavailable({ operation: "create-user", cause: error }),
        ),
      LockTimeoutError: (_, error) =>
        Effect.fail(
          new StorageUnavailable({ operation: "create-user", cause: error }),
        ),
      StatementTimeoutError: (_, error) =>
        Effect.fail(
          new StorageUnavailable({ operation: "create-user", cause: error }),
        ),
    }),
    // This feature declares the residual reasons unexpected; another feature
    // may instead translate them into a typed operational failure.
    Effect.catchTag("SqlError", Effect.die),
  )
```

- Choose the operator from the meaning of the transformation:

  | Intent | Operation |
  |---|---|
  | Handle one nested SQL reason | `Effect.catchReason` |
  | Handle a reason partition | `Effect.catchReasons` |
  | Translate `SqlError` inside a mixed error union | `Effect.catchTag("SqlError", …)` |
  | Translate every member of a homogeneous error channel identically | `Effect.mapError` |
  | Make the complete remaining error channel defective after composition | `Effect.orDie` |

- Enumerate the reasons you translate rather than catching `SqlError` whole.
  An exhaustive `catchReasons` turns a renamed or added reason into a build
  failure instead of a silently misclassified
  outage.[^applied-effect-local-executor]
- `reason.constraint` is best-effort: PostgreSQL trims it, but a missing,
  blank, or non-string constraint degrades to the literal string `"unknown"`,
  and other dialects recover it differently or not
  at all.[^test-pg-classification] Never let a domain decision depend on
  `constraint` without a fallback.
- Prefer the cheaper sibling where the database can express the rule.
  `INSERT … ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`, optionally with `RETURNING`, raises no
  violation at all; Effect's own event-log servers use both approaches, one per
  encryption variant.[^src-eventlog-encrypted] [^src-eventlog] Where
  first-party code does branch on a violation, it reads `error.reason._tag`
  in a small predicate and absorbs the conflict.[^src-eventlog] [^src-migrator]
- The official SQL walkthrough chooses `SqlError: Effect.die` at its `Groups`
  service boundary because that example declares database and encoding
  failures unexpected there. This demonstrates one legitimate repository
  policy; it is not a library default or a reason to convert every statement
  failure locally.[^docs-sql-basics]
- Do not introduce a helper merely as a shorter spelling of
  `catchTag("SqlError", Effect.die)`. A useful helper records reusable policy —
  such as the reason partition that constitutes storage unavailability — while
  allowing the owning feature to construct its public error. If a terminal
  helper is warranted, name its consequence explicitly, such as
  `dieOnUnexpectedSqlError`, and apply it at the boundary rather than to each
  statement. The language service makes the same placement distinction when it
  recommends hoisting repeated trailing `orDie` and `mapError`
  transformations.[^docs-effect-tsgo]

## Adapt the boundary with SqlSchema

- `SqlSchema.findAll`, `findNonEmpty`, `findOne`, and `findOneOption` take
  `{ Request, Result, execute }`, encode the request before running the
  statement, and decode unknown driver rows into the result
  schema.[^src-sql-schema] `SqlSchema.void` also exists, exported through a
  `void_ as void` alias that ordinary greps miss.
- Each adapter widens the error channel beyond `SqlError`: every helper adds
  `Schema.SchemaError`, and `findOne`/`findNonEmpty` add
  `Cause.NoSuchElementError`.[^src-sql-schema] Handle those separately — a row
  that fails to decode is schema drift, not a database outage.
- Keep each adapter next to the statement it decodes, as a named value built
  once at service construction, not per call.[^applied-effect-local-store]
  Designing the schemas themselves belongs to
  [Schema boundaries](schema-boundaries.md).

## Own the transaction boundary

The boundary belongs to the handler or use case that knows the atomicity
requirement. Data-access functions are participants: they return Effects that
join whatever transaction is in context, because `withTransaction` adds
`SqlError` to `E` and *nothing* to `R` — they cannot ask for a transaction and
cannot declare that they need one.[^src-sql-client] Open a nested
`withTransaction` only as an explicit scoped-rollback tool, never as a
default.[^applied-effect-local-store]

- Propagation is per client instance: the transaction connection lives under a
  tag minted per client (`.../TransactionConnection/<clientId>`), so a
  participant built from a *second* client silently runs outside the caller's
  transaction, with no type error and no runtime warning.[^src-sql-client] That
  is the concrete reason to publish one client under both tags.
- A statement that is only correct inside a transaction — `SELECT … FOR UPDATE`,
  or a no-op `UPDATE … RETURNING` used as a row lock — is still an ordinary
  participant. Its correctness is the caller's invariant, not something the
  signature can carry.[^applied-effect-local-store]
- Nested calls emit `SAVEPOINT effect_sql_<depth>` and serialize on a one-permit
  semaphore added to the transaction context, so concurrent children run
  sequentially. Savepoints are never released at rc.110 — nested success runs
  `Effect.void`, not `RELEASE SAVEPOINT` — so a long transaction accumulates
  them. An independent reimplementation of the same protocol issues the release
  explicitly, marking this as a gap rather than a
  design.[^src-sql-client] [^applied-opencode-session]
- Two Cloudflare carve-outs: `@effect/sql-d1` sets its transaction acquirer to
  `Effect.die("transactions are not supported in D1")`, so *any*
  `withTransaction` is a defect — use `D1Client.batch`, since Cloudflare
  documents batched statements as SQL
  transactions.[^src-d1-client] [^cf-d1-api] [^sqlite-transaction] Durable
  Object SQLite allows a top-level transaction but fails *nested* ones with a
  typed `SqlError`.[^src-sqlite-do]

## Keep query text out of your traces

- Every statement runs in a `sql.execute` client span carrying
  `db.operation.name` and `db.query.text`; the dialect layer adds
  `db.system.name` and `db.namespace`. These are OpenTelemetry *stable*
  database attributes, implemented by
  name.[^src-statement] [^src-pg-client] [^otel-db-spans]
- OTel says non-parameterized query text SHOULD NOT be collected without
  sanitization, and that parameterized text needs none. Effect sets
  `db.query.text` to the *compiled* SQL and passes parameters separately, so
  ordinary interpolation is safe by construction.[^src-statement] [^otel-db-spans]
- `sql.unsafe` and `sql.literal` inline their values into that same compiled
  string, which then ships to your tracing backend in clear text. Treat any
  user data or secret passed through them as exported.[^src-statement]
- `db.transaction.commit`/`rollback`/`savepoint` are Effect-specific span
  events on the `sql.transaction` span, not OTel semantic conventions; do not
  assume a vendor dashboard understands them.[^src-sql-client] [^otel-db-spans]
  Span naming policy in general belongs to
  [Observability](observability.md).

## Treat migrations as unsettled

`Migrator` exists, ten of the twelve dialect packages ship a binding, and it is
what the only official SQL example uses.[^src-migrator] [^docs-sql-basics] No
project in the reference corpus uses it: both serious SQL consumers replaced it
with their own schema-evolution machinery, and `@effect/sql-d1` and
`@effect/sql-sqlite-wasm` ship no migrator at
all.[^src-d1-client] [^applied-effect-local-store] Evaluate it against your
deployment model rather than adopting it as settled practice; in particular its
concurrency lock is an insert that relies on a unique or constraint
conflict.[^src-migrator]

## What this guide does not cover

| Concern | Owner | The one SQL-specific fact to carry across |
|---|---|---|
| Resolvers, batching, dedup | [Request batching and cache](request-batching-and-cache.md) | Resolver batching keys on the active transaction connection, so requests inside different transactions never batch together.[^src-sql-resolver] |
| Schema design, encode/decode policy, `Model.Class`, `SqlModel` | [Schema boundaries](schema-boundaries.md) | The database is an untrusted boundary; a decode failure is a different domain failure than a `SqlError`. |
| Streaming and pagination | [Streams](streams.md) | `Statement.stream` exists, but seven of twelve dialect packages implement `executeStream` as `Stream.die("executeStream not implemented")` — check your driver before designing around it.[^src-d1-client] |
| Connection lifetime, `sql.reserve`, finalizer ordering | [Resource safety](resource-safety.md) | Nesting yields savepoints, not new transactions; commit and rollback failures are `orDie`'d.[^src-sql-client] |
| D1, Durable Object SQLite, Worker request lifetime | [Cloudflare Workers](cloudflare-workers.md) | D1 has no migrator and dies on any transaction; DO SQLite rejects nested ones.[^src-d1-client] [^src-sqlite-do] |
| Error-channel design, `catchReason` as a combinator | [Error modeling](error-modeling.md) | `SqlError` is the canonical reason-carrying error; the idiom transfers to `PlatformError`, `AiError`, and `SocketError`.[^src-effect-catch-reason] |

## If you are writing a driver

Implement `SqlConnection.Connection` (`execute`, `executeRaw`, `executeValues`,
`executeUnprepared`, `executeStream`) and hand an `Acquirer` plus a compiler to
`SqlClient.make`.[^src-sql-connection] [^src-sql-client] Build the compiler with
`Statement.makeCompiler` or `Statement.makeCompilerSqlite`, apply
`Statement.defaultTransforms` for column naming, classify driver failures into
`SqlErrorReason` (`classifySqliteError` covers SQLite), honour the
`SqlClient.SafeIntegers` reference, and supply
`beginTransaction`/`commit`/`rollback`/`savepoint` SQL where your dialect's
spelling differs.[^src-statement] [^src-sql-error] [^src-sql-client] Then stop:
everything above this section is the consumer's contract.

## Review checklist

- Application services depend on `SqlClient`, not a dialect tag, and one client
  build is published under every tag that names it.
- No `sql.unsafe` or `sql.literal` carries user input or a secret.
- Ordinary statements and transaction participants preserve `SqlError`; every
  statement-local catch owns statement-specific domain meaning.
- Every `SqlError` translation names the reasons it handles; nothing catches
  `SqlError` whole and invents a message, and `reason.constraint` decisions
  have a fallback for `"unknown"`.
- Repeated terminal `catchTag("SqlError", Effect.die)` calls are hoisted to the
  owning boundary, and every residual defect conversion states why those
  reasons are unexpected there.
- `isRetryable` or an explicit reason list gates retry; unknown failures are
  not retried, and serialization or deadlock retry encloses the complete
  transaction.
- Transactions open at the handler or use case, every nested `withTransaction`
  has a written reason to exist, and no participant is built from a second
  client instance.
- Decode failures from `SqlSchema` are handled separately from driver failures.

[^src-sql-error]: `packages/effect/src/unstable/sql/SqlError.ts` at `effect@4.0.0-rc.110` — `SqlError` is a `Schema.TaggedError` with tag `"SqlError"` and a single `reason` field; `SqlErrorReason` is an eleven-member union; `ReasonFields` is `{ cause, message?, operation? }` and `UniqueViolation` adds `constraint: Schema.String`; each reason defines `get isRetryable()`, `true` for `ConnectionError`, `DeadlockError`, `SerializationError`, `LockTimeoutError`, `StatementTimeoutError` and `false` for the rest, including `UnknownError`; `SqlError.isRetryable` delegates to the reason. Also exports `isSqlError`, `isSqlErrorReason`, `classifySqliteError`, `ResultLengthMismatch`.
[^src-sql-client]: `packages/effect/src/unstable/sql/SqlClient.ts` at `effect@4.0.0-rc.110` — `SqlClient extends Constructor` with `reserve`, `withTransaction: <R, E, A>(self: Effect<A, E, R>) => Effect<A, E | SqlError, R>`, `transactionService`, `reactive`, `reactiveMailbox`; `makeWithTransaction` opens the `sql.transaction` span, emits `db.transaction.commit`/`savepoint`/`rollback` events, `Effect.orDie`s commit and rollback, adds a one-permit `Semaphore` to the transaction context so nested blocks serialize, and on nested success sets `effect = Effect.void` (no `RELEASE SAVEPOINT`); `TransactionConnection(clientId)` mints the tag `effect/sql/SqlClient/TransactionConnection/<clientId>` from a per-process counter; `SafeIntegers` is a `Context.Reference` defaulting to `false`.
[^src-statement]: `packages/effect/src/unstable/sql/Statement.ts` at `effect@4.0.0-rc.110` — `Statement<A> extends Fragment, Effect<ReadonlyArray<A>, SqlError>` with `raw`, `values`, `unprepared`, `stream`, `withoutTransform`, `compile()`; `Constructor` exposes the template call, identifier call, `unsafe`, `literal`, `in`, `insert`, `update`, `updateValues` (documented unsupported on SQLite), `and`, `or`, `csv`, `join`, `onDialect`; execution opens `Effect.useSpan("sql.execute", { kind: "client" })` and sets `db.operation.name` and `db.query.text` from the compiled SQL, with parameters passed separately to the connection. Driver-facing exports: `makeCompiler`, `makeCompilerSqlite`, `defaultTransforms`.
[^src-sql-schema]: `packages/effect/src/unstable/sql/SqlSchema.ts` at `effect@4.0.0-rc.110` — `findAll`, `findNonEmpty`, `findOne`, `findOneOption`, and `void_` re-exported as `void`; each takes `{ Request, Result, execute }`, adds `Schema.SchemaError` to the error channel, and `findOne`/`findNonEmpty` additionally fail with `Cause.NoSuchElementError`.
[^src-sql-resolver]: `packages/effect/src/unstable/sql/SqlResolver.ts` at `effect@4.0.0-rc.110` — every resolver constructor passes `key: transactionKey`, which reads the active `TransactionConnection` out of the request's context and keys by reference.
[^src-sql-stream]: `packages/effect/src/unstable/sql/SqlStream.ts` at `effect@4.0.0-rc.110` — 81 lines, sole export `asyncPauseResume`, documented as the interop layer used by SQL integrations to implement `Statement.stream` and `Connection.executeStream`.
[^src-migrator]: `packages/effect/src/unstable/sql/Migrator.ts` at `effect@4.0.0-rc.110` — `fromGlob`/`fromRecord` loaders, migrations run inside a transaction, and the concurrency lock is an insert whose failure is inspected with `isConstraintConflict` (`reason._tag === "ConstraintError" || "UniqueViolation"`) and mapped to `MigrationError({ kind: "Locked" })`. Dialect bindings exist for clickhouse, libsql, mssql, mysql2, pg, pglite, sqlite-bun, sqlite-do, sqlite-node, and sqlite-react-native — ten of twelve; d1 and sqlite-wasm ship none.
[^src-sql-connection]: `packages/effect/src/unstable/sql/SqlConnection.ts` at `effect@4.0.0-rc.110` — `Connection` interface and `Acquirer = Effect<Connection, SqlError, Scope>`.
[^src-pg-client]: `packages/sql/pg/src/PgClient.ts` at `effect@4.0.0-rc.110` — `classifyError` branches on SQLSTATE in order (`08*`, `28*`, `42501`, `42*`, `23505`, `23*`, `40P01`, `40001`, `55P03`, `57014`) and falls through to `UnknownError`; span attributes include `db.system.name` and `db.namespace`; `layerFrom`/`layerConfig`/`layer` all return `Layer<PgClient | SqlClient, …>` from a single `make`.
[^src-d1-client]: `packages/sql/d1/src/D1Client.ts` at `effect@4.0.0-rc.110` — `const transactionAcquirer = Effect.die("transactions are not supported in D1")`; `batch` is documented as executing statements "as a single atomic D1 batch"; `updateValues: never`; `executeStream` returns `Stream.die("executeStream not implemented")`, as it does in libsql, mssql, sqlite-bun, sqlite-node, sqlite-react-native, and sqlite-wasm.
[^src-sqlite-do]: `packages/sql/sqlite-do/src/SqliteClient.ts` at `effect@4.0.0-rc.110` — the storage-backed `withTransaction` fails with "Nested transactions are not supported by Cloudflare Durable Object SQLite storage" when a transaction connection is already in context.
[^src-eventlog]: `packages/effect/src/unstable/eventlog/SqlEventLogServerUnencrypted.ts` at `effect@4.0.0-rc.110` — a first-party rc.110 consumer that absorbs an insert race with `Effect.catchIf(isConstraintConflict, () => Effect.void)`, where the predicate reads `error.reason._tag`.
[^src-eventlog-encrypted]: `packages/effect/src/unstable/eventlog/SqlEventLogServerEncrypted.ts` at `effect@4.0.0-rc.110` — the same insert expressed as `sql.insert(batch.entries)` with `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`, so no violation is raised.
[^src-effect-catch-reason]: `packages/effect/src/Effect.ts` at `effect@4.0.0-rc.110` — `catchReason(errorTag, reasonTag, f, orElse?)`, `catchReasons(errorTag, cases, orElse?)`, and `unwrapReason(errorTag)`; `retry` accepts `{ while, schedule, times, until }`. The reason machinery is generic over any tagged error carrying a `reason` union, not SQL-specific.
[^docs-effect-tsgo]: Effect language service README at `Effect-TS/tsgo@83b8e2a` — `catchTagToCatchReason` recommends reason-specific combinators when a handler re-fails unmatched reasons; `redundantMapError` and `redundantOrDie` recommend hoisting repeated trailing transformations from individual `Effect.gen` yields.
[^docs-sql-basics]: `ai-docs/src/40_sql/10_basics.ts` and `ai-docs/src/40_sql/index.md` at `effect@4.0.0-rc.110` — the only official SQL walkthrough: `Model.Class`, `SqliteMigrator.layer`, `SqlModel.makeRepository`, one `SqlSchema.findAll`, and a repository boundary that maps `NoSuchElementError` to a domain error while dying on `SchemaError` and `SqlError`.
[^test-pg-classification]: `packages/sql/pg/test/SqlErrorClassification.test.ts` at `effect@4.0.0-rc.110` — 23505 yields a trimmed constraint name; missing, non-string, and blank constraints all yield `"unknown"`; 23503 stays a `ConstraintError`.
[^otel-db-spans]: OpenTelemetry semantic conventions `docs/db/database-spans.md` at tag `v1.44.0` — `db.operation.name` and `db.query.text` are Stable; note [15] states non-parameterized query text SHOULD NOT be collected by default without sanitization, and note [16] states parameterized query text SHOULD NOT be sanitized. No `db.transaction.*` event is defined.
[^pg-errcodes]: PostgreSQL 17 documentation, Appendix A — 23505 `unique_violation`, 40001 `serialization_failure`, 40P01 `deadlock_detected`, 55P03 `lock_not_available`, 42501 `insufficient_privilege`, 57014 `query_canceled`; class 08 connection exception, class 28 invalid authorization specification.
[^pg-serialization]: PostgreSQL 17 documentation, 13.5 Serialization Failure Handling — applications must retry serialization failures, may retry deadlocks with care, and must retry the complete transaction including logic that decides which SQL and values to use.
[^cf-d1-api]: Cloudflare D1 Worker API documentation — "Batched statements are SQL transactions. If a statement in the sequence fails, then an error is returned for that specific statement, and it aborts or rolls back the entire sequence." Read 2026-08-17; Cloudflare does not version these docs.
[^sqlite-transaction]: SQLite documentation, `lang_transaction.html` — transactions started with `BEGIN` do not nest; `SAVEPOINT`/`RELEASE` are the nesting mechanism, and `ROLLBACK TO` unwinds to a savepoint. Read 2026-08-17; SQLite does not version this page.
[^applied-alchemy-d1]: Observed in alchemy-effect@1596e503 `packages/alchemy/src/SQL/D1.ts` (effect 4.0.0-rc.110) — `Layer.effect(Sql.SqlClient, …).pipe(Layer.provideMerge(Layer.effect(D1Client.D1Client, …)))`, with an in-source comment stating the motive: "so both tags share one per-execution client (and one prepared-statement cache)". The same shape appears in that package's `SQL/Postgres.ts` and `SQL/MySQL.ts`.
[^applied-alchemy-routes]: Observed in alchemy-effect@1596e503 `packages/alchemy/test/SQL/fixtures/routes.ts` (effect 4.0.0-rc.110) — a fixture, but a released library's cross-dialect conformance surface: `sql.unsafe` DDL, `sql(table)` identifiers, single- and multi-row `sql.insert`, `sql.update(row, ["id"])`, `sql.in`, `sql.or` over a nested `sql.and`, prefix-form `sql.csv`, and `sql.literal`.
[^applied-alchemy-lock]: Observed in alchemy-effect@1596e503 `packages/alchemy/src/Auth/Lock.ts` (effect 4.0.0-rc.110) — `Effect.catchReason("PlatformError", "AlreadyExists", …)` converting one reason into a domain failure, then retrying on that domain tag. Not SQL, but the same rc.110 idiom on a reason-carrying error.
[^applied-effect-local-executor]: Observed in effect-local@faa52d9 `packages/local-sql/src/QueryExecutor.ts` (effect 4.0.0-beta.103) — `Effect.catchReasons("SqlError", { ConnectionError, LockTimeoutError, StatementTimeoutError, DeadlockError, SerializationError })` mapping all five to one `StorageUnavailable`, followed by `Effect.catchTag("SqlError", …)` for statement faults; an adjacent comment states the rationale, that holding the list to the reason union makes a renamed reason a build failure instead of a silent reclassification. The same file uses `.compile()` to inspect statement text before execution.
[^applied-effect-local-store]: Observed in effect-local@faa52d9 `packages/local-sql/src/ServerStore.ts` and `SchemaEvolution.ts` (effect 4.0.0-beta.103) — `SqlSchema.findOne` adapters built once at construction; `lockSpace`, a no-op `UPDATE … RETURNING` used as a row lock and only correct inside the caller's transaction; a deliberately nested `sql.withTransaction` whose failure is converted to a `Result` after rollback; and a hand-written schema-evolution engine in place of `Migrator`.
[^applied-opencode-session]: Observed in opencode@65c3597 `packages/effect-drizzle-sqlite/src/effect-sqlite/session.ts` (effect 4.0.0-beta.83) — an independent reimplementation of the same savepoint protocol that additionally issues `release savepoint effect_sql_<id>` on nested success. Note on version: no production `withTransaction` usage exists in the corpus at rc.110, so this section's "how people write it today" support is beta-era. The mechanism claim is unaffected — `makeWithTransaction` is byte-identical in shape across beta.83, beta.103, and rc.110, and this reimplementation matches it line for line except for the release.
