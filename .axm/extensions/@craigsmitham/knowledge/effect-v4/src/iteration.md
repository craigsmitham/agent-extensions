# Iteration

Choose by effectfulness, shape, cardinality, and time semantics.

**Applies when** replacing `Promise.all`, async loops, polling, retries, manual
accumulators, or unbounded per-item effects, and when deciding among `forEach`,
`all`, `whileLoop`, `repeat`, and `Stream`.

**Leave alone** pure synchronous transformations already clear with ordinary
collection code.

Related: [Structured concurrency](structured-concurrency.md) for
sibling-failure, race, and interruption semantics, [Streams](streams.md) when
production is lazy or unbounded, [Error modeling](error-modeling.md) for what
is safe to retry, [Async coordination](async-coordination.md) for choosing
coordination primitives.

## Choose the operation

- Use ordinary collection operations or a plain loop for pure synchronous work.
- Use `Effect.forEach` for one effectful operation per element. It preserves
  typed failures, short-circuits on the first failure, and is sequential
  unless concurrency is explicitly requested.[^src-effect]
- Use `Effect.all` for a fixed tuple, struct, or collection of already-built
  effects. It preserves tuple/struct result shape.[^src-effect]
- There is no `Effect.iterate` or `Effect.loop` in v4. Model a
  condition-driven loop with `Effect.whileLoop({ while, body, step })`, write
  explicit state machines with `Effect.gen` plus an ordinary loop or
  recursion, and unfold pure successive values with
  `Stream.iterate`.[^src-effect]
- Use `Schedule` with retry or repeat for temporal policies, including
  polling.[^docs-schedule] [^applied-opencode-polling] Use `Stream` for lazy,
  unbounded, resource-scoped, or backpressured production of
  values.[^docs-streams]

```ts
import { Effect } from "effect"

const results = Effect.forEach(inputs, processOne, {
  concurrency: 8,
})

const pair = Effect.all({ profile: loadProfile, settings: loadSettings }, {
  concurrency: "unbounded",
})
```

## Make execution policy visible

- Concurrency is opt-in and is a number or `"unbounded"`.[^src-types] Choose a
  numeric bound from downstream capacity; reserve `"unbounded"` for a
  genuinely small, fixed set.[^test-effect] [^applied-opencode]
- Use `{ discard: true }` when only effects matter and result collection would
  allocate useless output.[^src-effect]
- Decide whether failure short-circuits, is accumulated, or becomes per-item
  data. Do not recover broadly merely to keep a loop running.[^applied-opencode]
- Keep retries bounded and conditional on typed retryable failures — defects
  and interruption are not retried. Separate attempt count, delay/backoff,
  jitter, and overall timeout.[^src-effect] [^applied-dfx]
- Preserve interruption. Do not wrap traversal in detached promises or swallow
  cancellation while waiting between attempts.

## Avoid manual machinery

- Do not use `Promise.all` inside an Effect program.
- Replace `for` + `yield*` + `push` with `Effect.forEach` unless the loop has
  genuinely complex early-exit or state-transition behavior.
- Do not implement polling with recursive sleep flags; model it with repeat,
  retry, Schedule, or Stream according to the result
  contract.[^applied-opencode-polling]
- A traversal option is enough when one traversal owns the limit; use a
  Semaphore only when the limit is shared across call
  sites.[^applied-effect-local] [Async coordination](async-coordination.md)
  owns the Semaphore primitive itself.

## Review checklist

- Pure work stays pure; effectful work stays in the Effect channel.
- Sequential versus concurrent execution is explicit.
- Parallelism is bounded by an identified capacity.
- Failure, retry, timeout, and interruption semantics are intentional.
- The selected primitive exists in v4 and preserves the required result shape
  and cardinality.

[^src-effect]: `packages/effect/src/Effect.ts` at `effect@4.0.0-rc.110` — `forEach` ("By default, the operations are performed sequentially", short-circuit, `discard`), `Effect.all` shape preservation and `mode: "result"`, `whileLoop`, `retry` ("Defects and interruptions are not retried"), `repeat`; no `iterate` or `loop` export. `Stream.iterate`: `packages/effect/src/Stream.ts`.
[^src-types]: `packages/effect/src/Types.ts` at `effect@4.0.0-rc.110` — `Concurrency = number | "unbounded"`.

[^test-effect]: `packages/effect/test/Effect.test.ts` at `effect@4.0.0-rc.110` — forEach sequential default and bounded/unbounded concurrency behavior.
[^applied-opencode]: Observed in opencode@2cba7e2 `packages/core/src/git.ts` (effect 4.0.0-beta.83) — `Effect.all` at `concurrency: 2` for a fixed pair, `forEach` at `concurrency: 8` for a variable file list, per-item stat failures converted to data.
[^applied-opencode-polling]: Observed in opencode@2cba7e2 `packages/core/src/models-dev.ts` (effect 4.0.0-beta.83) — refresh piped through `Effect.repeat(Schedule.spaced("60 minutes"))`.
[^applied-dfx]: Observed in dfx@23988a4 `src/DiscordGateway/DiscordWS.ts` (effect 4.0.0-beta.105) — `Effect.retry({ while })` on a typed close error, reconnects under `Schedule.min([Schedule.exponential(500), Schedule.spaced(10000)])`.
[^applied-effect-local]: Observed in effect-local@faa52d9 `packages/local-browser/src/MultiTab.ts` (effect 4.0.0-beta.103) — `Effect.forEach(..., { discard: true })` release traversal guarded by a shared Semaphore permit.
