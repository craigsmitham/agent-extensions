# Execution evaluations

Activate the skill explicitly so routing cannot conceal destination defects.
Give it only declared inputs and task-local fixtures, then grade observable
results rather than persuasive narration. Representative examples and skill
evaluations should cover realistic success and failure behavior.[^anthropic-best-practices]

Cover the happy path, an important edge, a missing or malformed input, a tool or
resource failure, and a request beyond the skill's authority. Where scripts or
templates are contractual, verify that the skill discovers and uses them by
relative path and handles their failure honestly.

Evidence should answer:

- Did the promised artifact or state appear and satisfy its contract?
- Did the workflow follow required ordering and validation gates?
- Were side effects, permissions, and user decisions kept within scope?
- Did recovery preserve data and expose uncertainty?
- Was the work materially more reliable or efficient than the baseline?

Keep evaluator failures distinct from skill failures. An unavailable host,
credential, or fixture yields an untested expectation, not a passing one.
