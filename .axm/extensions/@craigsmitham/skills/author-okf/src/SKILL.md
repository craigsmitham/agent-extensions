# Authoring OKF bundles

OKF v0.2 represents knowledge as a directory of markdown files with YAML frontmatter. No schema
registry, no central authority, no required tooling. This skill covers producing conformant bundles
and keeping them coherent as they grow.

The full spec is vendored at `references/SPEC.md` (pinned to upstream commit `3fcbb9f`, retrieved
2026-07-27). Read it for Attested Computation details (§10), the v0.1 migration (§13), or any
question this file does not answer. Do not fetch the spec from the network — the vendored copy is
the version this skill targets.

## Invariants

1. **Every non-reserved `.md` file has parseable YAML frontmatter with a non-empty `type`.** This is
   the whole of conformance, along with reserved-file structure. Nothing else can make a bundle
   non-conformant.
2. **`index.md` and `log.md` are reserved at every directory level.** Never author a concept under
   either name.
3. **Reuse `type` values that already exist in the bundle.** See [Type discipline](#type-discipline).
4. **Run the validator before declaring work done.** See [Validate](#validate).
5. **Never invent provenance.** `sources`, `generated.by`, and `verified` are trust claims. Record
   what actually happened; omit the field when you do not know. Absence is meaningful and always
   permitted — a fabricated `verified: { by: human:... }` entry is worse than no entry.

## Progressive discovery

Design discovery outside-in so each surface gives a human or agent only enough information to
choose the next useful surface. Then verify inside-out that every narrower surface fulfills the
promise made above it.

| Surface | Reader decision | Authoring contract |
|---|---|---|
| Publisher or catalog metadata, when present | Is this bundle relevant? | One sentence naming the domain and distinctive scope; for an AXM package this is `knowledge.json.description`. |
| Root `index.md` | Where should I begin? | Bundle title, a short scope-and-use introduction, then the major reader-facing routes. |
| Nested `index.md` | Which part of this area matters? | State the grouping principle and enumerate the immediate concepts or narrower sections. |
| Concept preview or search result | Is this the exact concept? | Distinctive `title` and `description`, stable `type`, and query vocabulary in `tags`. |
| Concept body | What knowledge applies? | The detail promised by its metadata, organized for reading and retrieval. |

Browsing and search are parallel routes. Indexes support browsing; concept metadata must stand on
its own when search bypasses every index.

For repository-level collection paths, filenames, and titles that OKF does not prescribe, apply
the repository's documentation naming and information-architecture guidance. This skill owns OKF
conformance and bundle coherence, not the host repository's documentation taxonomy.

- Let each description become more specific: bundle scope → section scope → concept distinction.
  Do not repeat one generic description at every level.
- Treat `title` as a concept's canonical display name. Use it exactly as index link text and,
  normally, as the document-title heading; use a stable slug for the filename. Keep conventional
  headings such as `# Computation` when the spec assigns them meaning.
- Copy a concept's `description` into its index entry. For a subdirectory entry, describe what that
  section contains and how it differs from its siblings.
- Organize indexes by distinctions readers recognize, not incidental storage or source layout.
  Add a nested index when one page mixes different reader questions or becomes hard to scan, not
  merely after an arbitrary file count.
- Keep substantive knowledge out of indexes, and keep every concept reachable from the root
  through meaningful index entries.

## Workflows

### Create a new bundle

1. Confirm the bundle root, audience, scope, important exclusions, and top-level grouping with the
   user. Directories are a domain choice, not a spec choice (`tables/`, `metrics/`, `playbooks/`).
2. Draft the one-sentence publisher description when the bundle has one, then sketch the root and
   any nested indexes from `templates/index.md`. This is the discovery map, not final content.
3. Create concepts from `templates/concept.md`, one file per concept. Concept ID is the bundle-
   relative path minus `.md`; reconcile each finished body with its drafted title and description.
4. Finish the root `index.md` with `okf_version: "0.2"` and the exact concept titles and
   descriptions. This is the only `index.md` permitted to have frontmatter.
5. Start `log.md` at the root with an initialization entry (`templates/log.md`).
6. Walk the bundle once from the root index and once by likely search terms, then validate.

### Convert existing material into OKF

1. **Inventory first.** List the source material and decide the concept split before writing
   anything. One source document often becomes several concepts; resist a 1:1 mapping.
2. **Draft the discovery map.** State the bundle's promise, group the concepts by reader-recognizable
   distinctions, and draft a title plus one-sentence description for each concept.
3. **Assign types** from the existing bundle's vocabulary, or mint a small starter set and write it
   down. Do not let each file invent its own.
4. **Record provenance honestly.** Each converted concept gets a `sources` entry whose `resource`
   is the material it came from — an absolute URL, a bundle-relative path, or a scope descriptor
   like `all queries in BigQuery project X` when there is no single artifact. Give each source an
   `id` when the body cites it.
5. **Attribute per claim** with footnotes keyed to `sources[].id`, not a citations list:

   ```markdown
   The `events_` table is sharded daily as `events_YYYYMMDD`.[^ga4-schema]

   [^ga4-schema]: GA4 BigQuery Export schema
   ```

6. **Set `generated`** to the actor that actually did the conversion, e.g.
   `generated: { by: claude/opus-5, at: <now, ISO 8601> }`. Do not set `verified` — conversion is
   generation, not verification. A human reviewer adds `verified` afterwards.
7. Prefer structural markdown (tables, lists, fenced blocks) over prose paragraphs. Both humans and
   retrieval do better with structure.
8. Reconcile the completed concepts with the discovery map, walk both browse and search routes, and
   validate.

### Extend or maintain an existing bundle

**Read before writing.** Scan the bundle for its existing `type` values, directory conventions, and
actor strings, and match them. The validator's `--summary` prints the type inventory:

```bash
python3 scripts/validate_okf.py <bundle> --summary
```

Then:

- Update `generated.at` when content changes meaningfully. Leave `verified` alone — content can
  change without re-confirmation, and stale `verified` entries are informative, not errors.
- Add a `verified` entry only on an actual verification event. Append to the list; do not overwrite.
- Refresh `stale_after` only when the content was genuinely re-confirmed.
- Mark superseded concepts `status: deprecated` rather than deleting them — inbound links survive.
- Update the enclosing `index.md`; if bundle scope changed, also update the root introduction and
  any publisher description. Append a dated `log.md` entry in the same change.
- Validate.

### Validate or audit a bundle

```bash
python3 scripts/validate_okf.py <bundle>              # errors + warnings
python3 scripts/validate_okf.py <bundle> --info       # also recommended-field gaps
python3 scripts/validate_okf.py <bundle> --summary    # type inventory, trust tiers, staleness
python3 scripts/validate_okf.py <bundle> --json       # machine-readable
```

Report findings by severity and fix `error` findings before reporting done. Weigh `warn` findings
on their merits — several are advisory by design (broken links are explicitly legal per §11).

## Frontmatter reference

`type` is the only always-required key. A concept carrying just `type` is fully conformant.

| Field | Req | Form | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `type` | **yes** | string | Kind of concept. Uncontrolled vocabulary — see [Type discipline](#type-discipline). |
| `title` | rec | string | Canonical display name. Use exact wording in index links. Consumers may fall back to the filename. |
| `description` | rec | string | One sentence distinguishing this concept from its neighbors. Reuse it in index entries and search snippets. |
| `resource` | rec | URI/path | Canonical URI of the underlying asset. Omit for abstract concepts. |
| `tags` | rec | list | Stable domain terms, aliases, and query vocabulary; do not merely repeat the title. |
| `sources` | opt | list | Provenance. Each entry needs `resource`; `id`, `title`, `author`, `usage_count`, `last_modified` optional. |
| `usage_window` | opt | `{from, to}` | Sibling of `sources`; frames every `usage_count`. Dates are `YYYY-MM-DD`. |
| `generated` | opt | `{by, at}` | `by` required within it; an actor. `at` = last meaningful content change, ISO 8601 datetime. |
| `verified` | opt | list of `{by, at}` | Verification events. A bare mapping is a one-element list. |
| `status` | opt | enum | `draft` \| `stable` \| `deprecated`. Absent means `stable`. |
| `stale_after` | opt | `YYYY-MM-DD` | Absolute date, not a TTL. Stale when `today >= stale_after`. |

Producers may add any other keys; consumers must preserve them. Use that freedom sparingly — a
custom key no consumer reads is dead weight.

**Trust tiers** are derived, never stored: no `verified` key → unverified; `verified` by non-`human:`
actors only → machine-confirmed; at least one `human:<id>` → human-reviewed.

### Actor convention

Identity fields (`generated.by`, `verified[].by`) use exactly one of:

- `<producer>/<version>` — agents and tools, e.g. `reference_agent/gemini-2.5-pro`
- `human:<id>` — people, e.g. `human:ahormati`
- `process:<id>` — automated processes, e.g. `process:finance-nightly`

The `human:` prefix is load-bearing: it is what raises a concept to the human-reviewed tier. Use it
for hand-authored and human-confirmed content, and never for agent output.

`sources[].author` nominally uses the same convention, but the spec's own examples use a team form
(`team:finance-fpa`). Both are accepted; the validator only flags freeform values here.

## Type discipline

`type` is deliberately not centrally registered, which means an unguided author produces
`BigQuery Table`, `BQ Table`, and `Table` in three files of the same bundle. That costs consumers
their routing and filtering.

Before adding a concept, list the types already in use (`--summary`) and reuse an exact match. Mint
a new type only when nothing fits, and prefer a descriptive, self-explanatory noun phrase in title
case. The validator flags near-duplicate types that differ only in case, spacing, or punctuation.

Common starting values: `BigQuery Table`, `BigQuery Dataset`, `API Endpoint`, `Metric`, `Playbook`,
`Reference`, `Attested Computation`.

## Links and paths

Prefer **bundle-relative** links beginning with `/` — they survive a document moving within its
subdirectory:

```markdown
See the [customers table](/tables/customers.md) for the join key.
```

Relative links (`./other.md`) are also valid. Links are untyped: the relationship kind lives in the
surrounding prose, not the link. Consumers must tolerate broken links, so a link to a not-yet-written
concept is legitimate — the validator reports these as warnings so you can tell intent from typo.

Path-valued fields (`resource`, `sources[].resource`, `computation`, `executor.resource`,
`attester.resource`) accept an absolute URL, a bundle-relative path, or a relative path. A
`references/` subdirectory conventionally holds mirrored external material, run instructions, and
attester code as first-class bundle files.

## Reserved files

**`index.md`** — optional at any level, supports progressive disclosure. No frontmatter, except a
bundle-root `index.md` may carry `okf_version: "0.2"`. Open with a title and short scope-and-use
introduction, then use headed groups of link entries. Concept titles and descriptions should match
their frontmatter; subdirectory descriptions should distinguish the section from its siblings.

```markdown
# Bundle or section title

Short statement of scope, intended use, and important boundaries.

## Reader-facing group

* [Exact concept title](relative-url) - exact concept description
* [Section title](subdir/) - what belongs in this section and distinguishes it
```

**`log.md`** — optional at any level, newest first. `##` headings **must** be ISO `YYYY-MM-DD`. The
leading bold word is convention, not requirement.

```markdown
# Directory Update Log

## 2026-05-22
* **Update**: Added a BigQuery table reference for [Customer Metrics](/tables/customer-metrics.md).
* **Creation**: Established the [Dataplex Playbook](/playbooks/dataplex.md).
```

## Attested Computation

A concept of `type: Attested Computation` carries a sanctioned computation so a consumer can confirm
the blessed thing ran rather than agent-improvised SQL. Start from
`templates/attested-computation.md` and read `references/SPEC.md` §10 — the contract has real
subtleties this summary omits.

Essentials: `runtime` is **required** for this type (`bigquery`, `postgres`, `dbt`, `python`,
`Looker`, …) and defines what `parameters` mean. Supply the computation *either* inline as one fenced
block under `# Computation` *or* via a `computation:` path — never both. `executor.resource` names
run instructions and `executor.receipt` lists the fields a run must return; `attester.resource`
names deterministic, no-LLM verification code.

One rule matters above the rest: **an agent may only supply parameter *values*. It must never
author or edit the computation.** That parameter-only surface is what makes attestation a mechanical
comparison instead of a judgement call. If a computation looks wrong, say so — do not rewrite it.

Keep each figure its own Attested Computation concept and link to it from the narrative concept that
uses it; revenue and profit verify, go stale, and attest independently.

## Validate

Always finish by running the validator over the bundle root:

```bash
python3 scripts/validate_okf.py <bundle-root>
```

It needs PyYAML (`pip install pyyaml`) and exits non-zero when errors are present. `error` findings
are spec violations — fix them. `warn` and `info` findings are producer SHOULDs and authoring
hazards; judge each one rather than silencing it reflexively.
