# Context engineering

Design and maintain the informational environment agents receive, discover,
produce, and carry through work. This pack combines context, prompt, and
evaluation-engineering knowledge with workflows for gardening project context
and improving persistent instruction files.

Prompt engineering is included as a reusable discipline because model-facing
instructions appear in instruction files, tools, workflows, applications, and
other context surfaces. Harness engineering remains separate and owns the
larger runtime, interfaces, state, feedback, authority, and containment system.

## Included extensions

| Extension | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `@craigsmitham/knowledge/context-engineering` | Context selection, authority, routing, retrieval, memory, compaction, evaluation, and lifecycle |
| `@craigsmitham/knowledge/prompt-engineering` | Prompt contracts, structure, examples, templates, presentation, evaluation, trust, and compatibility |
| `@craigsmitham/knowledge/eval-engineering` | Shared evaluation contracts, task distributions, trials, graders, uncertainty, validity, and suite lifecycle |
| `@craigsmitham/skills/garden-context` | Audits and improves project or workspace context from representative work |
| `@craigsmitham/skills/improve-instructions` | Audits, trims, reindexes, and localizes persistent instruction files |

The skills are coupled to their direct knowledge siblings and should be
installed through this pack. Each knowledge bundle may also be installed
independently.

## Install

```bash
axm packs install @craigsmitham/packs/context-engineering
