# modularize

Modularize a codebase or a specified part around cohesive responsibilities that can evolve independently.

The concise [skill](src/SKILL.md) describes the desired outcome and leaves
methods to the caller and model. Boundaries follow responsibilities and
reasons for change; improvement may involve bringing related knowledge
together or separating independently changing policies.

## Usage

Invoke this skill directly during maintenance with a scope. Automatic model
invocation is disabled through the supported native settings.

```text
$modularize src/billing/ around independently changing responsibilities
$modularize the importer so format changes remain local
$modularize pricing so domain policy is independent of infrastructure adapters
```

## Dependency boundaries

Dependencies and boundary contracts should let responsibilities evolve
independently. Domain policy remains independent of delivery and infrastructure
details; reusable capabilities remain independent of their consumers' specialized
policies. Integrations own translation and composition between those boundaries.

DDD's core, supporting, and generic classifications describe strategic roles;
they do not prescribe an import hierarchy. A supporting domain can have its own
business rules. An adapter can depend on a core domain's contract while the
generic capability it connects remains independent of that domain's model.

For example, pricing can own a tax-quote contract that an integration adapter
implements using a generic tax client. Pricing does not import the adapter,
and the tax client does not import pricing. Appropriate translation preserves
each model's meaning; sharing types is useful when their meaning and ownership
are actually shared.

The skill defines these outcomes without prescribing a particular architecture,
directory layout, or an interface for every implementation.

balance between cohesion, independent change, and shared knowledge.

Dependency-boundary guidance also draws on:

  especially Generic Subdomains, Segregated Core, Shared Kernel, and Anticorruption
  Layer, for separating models and making integration ownership explicit.

  for dependency direction and contracts owned by the policy they protect.
