# Software architecture overview

Software architecture comprises the durable structural concepts, properties,
and consequential decisions by which a system retains its intended qualities
as its implementation changes. An architecture description expresses selected
parts of that architecture for particular stakeholders and concerns; the
architecture and its description are not the same thing.[^iso-42010]

Within this bundle, architecture concepts record accepted subject,
responsibility, relationship, decision, and response meaning. Requirement
concepts alone record accepted obligations of the documented System and
eligible architecture subjects. A system also has an effective architecture
expressed through its implemented structure and behavior. Source code and
configuration show current implementation, tests and contracts establish
supported behavior, and a proposal explores a possible future. When these
authorities disagree, the disagreement is something to resolve; none silently
takes over another's responsibility.

Architecture should remain useful through a substantial rewrite. It may name
stable elements and constrain their relationships, but it should not mirror a
directory tree, endpoint inventory, dependency list, or delivery plan that an
executable source can provide more accurately.

Architecture may include strategic, demand-and-value, capability, behavior,
interaction, domain-authority, structural, dynamic, deployment, and quality
views when they answer real stakeholder concerns. These views describe one
documented System; their directories and diagrams are discovery mechanisms
rather than one universal containment model.

## Non-responsibilities

Architecture does not specify every implementation decision, catalog all
features, reproduce exact interfaces, or record all historical proposals. It
does not replace detailed design near the code. It preserves the meaning and
structural response that are difficult to infer locally and expensive to
rediscover, while accepted binding constraints remain Requirements.

Architecture documentation is selective by necessity. ISO 42010 frames an
architecture description around stakeholders, concerns, viewpoints, and
views.[^iso-42010] A useful set of architecture docs is therefore not the largest one; it is the
one that exposes the decisions needed by its actual readers.

[^iso-42010]: ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010 defines requirements for expressing
    architecture descriptions across software, systems, enterprises, and
    related entities.
