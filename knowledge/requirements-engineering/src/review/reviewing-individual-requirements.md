# Reviewing individual requirements

Scale review depth to consequence, novelty, ambiguity, and change cost. Check
the record, not just the sentence.

- [ ] The [content contract](../authoring/requirement-content-contract.md) is
      satisfied: identity and authority, sources, bounded obligation, terms and
      scope, relationships, assessment basis, and history are recoverable.
- [ ] The [individual quality characteristics](../specification-methods/iso-iec-ieee-29148-requirement-quality.md#characteristics-of-an-individual-requirement)
      are assessed for the applicable obligation and audience.
- [ ] Independently decidable obligations are separated without destroying an
      atomic rule or invariant; design detail has an accepted constraint basis.
- [ ] Conflicts, assumptions, and unresolved decisions remain visible.
- [ ] Verification can distinguish satisfaction from failure, and validation
      supports stakeholder need and intended use; neither creates acceptance.

Record findings with severity, location, evidence, and the decision needed.
Review does not itself accept a candidate or approve a change unless the local
policy grants the reviewer that authority.

## Worked continuation

Use Northbank's requirement specimens (shared concept: `@craigsmitham/knowledge/software-engineering-foundations#cases/northbank-commitment-requirements`)
to inspect one obligation's subject, scope, authority, counterexample, and
assessment basis. For `NB-REPLACE-01`, “preserve prior allocation state” does not
mean “the former machine is ready.” A review must preserve that distinction
rather than repair ambiguity by importing an unstated physical guarantee.
