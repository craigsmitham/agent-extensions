# Schema boundaries

Decode once at ingress, use trusted domain values internally, and encode at egress.

**Applies when** JSON or external input is cast, validation is duplicated or ad
hoc, wire and domain representations differ, constructors bypass invariants, or
output is encoded manually — even without current Schema usage.

**Leave alone** data already trusted and kept inside a validated boundary.

Related: [Branded types](branded-types.md) for the scalar invariants a schema
reuses, [Option](option.md) for nullish encoded fields, [Error
modeling](error-modeling.md) for translating parse failures at the protocol
boundary.

## Establish the boundary

- Treat network, storage, environment, form, and parsed JSON values as
  `unknown`. Decode them with an unknown decoder such as
  `Schema.decodeUnknownEffect` at the first trusted boundary; never cast
  external data into the domain type.[^docs-schema-basics] [^applied-opencode]
- Use a schema instance's `.make`/`.makeEffect` (or `.makeOption`) for
  already-typed construction that still needs type-side validation, not as a
  substitute for decoding unknown input. Module-level `Schema.make(ast)` is a
  different function: it builds a schema from an AST, not a
  value.[^src-schema]
- Use Effectful decoding when transformations or validation require services
  or asynchronous work; the decode result carries the schema's
  `DecodingServices`.[^src-schema]
- Decode failures stay structured: `SchemaError` wraps a path-aware issue.
  Preserve it long enough to report the failing path, and map it to domain or
  protocol errors only where that vocabulary
  belongs.[^applied-effect-local]

## Own representation changes

- Let a schema transformation define the relationship between encoded and
  domain representations, and encode at egress through the same schema that
  decoded ingress.[^docs-schema-basics]
- Keep wire compatibility decisions at adapters; do not leak encoded shapes
  through the domain.
- Put defaults, optionality, nullish conversion, and representation transforms
  in the schema that owns that boundary. The `Option`-to-nullable bridge is
  owned by [Option](option.md).
- Choose strictness deliberately: excess-property handling is a `ParseOptions`
  decision (`onExcessProperty: "ignore" | "error" | "preserve"`), not an
  accident.[^src-schema-ast]

## Choose the domain carrier

```ts
import { Schema } from "effect"

// Structural data: a Struct plus its derived type.
export const UserSchema = Schema.Struct({
  id: UserIdSchema,
  displayName: Schema.String,
})
export type User = typeof UserSchema.Type

// Domain model constructed only from valid data: a class carrier.
export class Account extends Schema.Class<Account>("app/Account")({
  id: AccountIdSchema,
  displayName: Schema.String,
}) {}
```

- Default to `Schema.Struct`: name the schema `<TypeName>Schema`, derive
  `<TypeName>` from its `.Type`, and export them together when consumers need
  both runtime and static contracts.
- Choose `Schema.Class` when a domain model should only be constructed from
  valid data or benefits from methods and `instanceof`: the class itself is
  the validated type, and both `new` and the static `.make` construct through
  the schema.[^docs-schema-basics] [^schema-md]
- `Schema.Opaque` sits between: a distinct TypeScript type over a plain
  struct, without prototype-backed instances or methods.[^schema-md]
- Use `.Encoded` when code truly works with the wire representation; do not
  substitute it for the trusted domain type.

## Keep one source of truth

- Reuse schema-derived types and constructors instead of parallel interfaces,
  predicates, and validators whose fields can drift from the schema.
- Do not validate repeatedly after a value has crossed a trustworthy boundary.
- Test valid decode, representative invalid paths, typed construction, encode,
  and round-trip laws where a transformation claims reversibility.

## Review checklist

- Every external input enters as `unknown` and is decoded once.
- Already-typed construction uses the schema instance's `.make`/`.makeEffect`;
  nothing is merely cast.
- Schema and derived type — or the class carrier — share one exported naming
  decision.
- Encoded and domain representations are not mixed inside feature logic.
- Transformations, defaults, and excess-property strictness have explicit
  direction and compatibility rules.
- Error translation preserves useful schema paths at the protocol boundary.

[^src-schema]: `packages/effect/src/Schema.ts` at `effect@4.0.0-rc.111` — instance `.make`/`.makeOption`/`.makeEffect`; module-level `Schema.make(ast)`; `decodeUnknownEffect` carries `DecodingServices` and fails with `SchemaError` wrapping a structured issue.
