# Cross-cutting concerns for software quality

This concept defines how concerns that affect several
[software quality pillars](software-quality-pillars.md) should be represented
without turning them into additional product qualities or a miscellaneous
topic list. It is a research-grounded candidate model, not a claim that every
codebase has eight such concerns or that every relationship always applies.

The central rule is:

> A concern is cross-cutting because a coherent subject or mechanism has
> explicit, conditional relationships to several product-quality outcomes—not
> because it is broadly important or difficult to place.

Cross-cutting is therefore a relationship pattern. It is not an ontological
role. A design principle, engineering-system capability, assurance mechanism,
evidence property, or contextual condition can cross several pillars while
remaining a different kind of thing from those pillars. This use extends the
software-design idea that cross-cutting depends on the chosen decomposition:
a concern cuts across one primary organization while retaining its own
coherent identity.[^kiczales]

The model is published as four concepts. This one owns the rule, the roster,
and the classification and admission tests. The others own the record
definitions, the typed pillar relationships, and the maintenance and
validation plan:

- [Cross-cutting concern records](cross-cutting-concern-records.md) defines
  each of the eight records with its inclusions, exclusions, and pillar reach.
- [Cross-cutting relationships to the quality pillars](cross-cutting-pillar-relationships.md)
  supplies the relationship vocabulary, the concern-by-pillar matrix, and the
  placement of testing and testability.
- [Maintaining the cross-cutting concern model](cross-cutting-model-maintenance.md)
  covers knowledge organization, validation trials, and research limits.

## Decision in brief

Keep eight canonical records with singular semantic heads. Present them in
three roles so the two universal envelopes are not mistaken for six topical
concerns of the same kind.

| ID | Record | Presentation role | Primary assessment subject | Primary conceptual role | Core question |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `XC-01` | Claim context | Framing envelope | Context or environment | Contextual condition | Under exactly which subject, stakeholder, use, environment, lifecycle, and consequence conditions is a quality claim intended to hold? |
| `XC-02` | Specification | Concern family | Supporting artifact | Supporting-artifact quality | Are intended needs, required qualities, behavioral contracts, invariants, and acceptance bounds explicit and traceable enough to govern the relevant product claims? |
| `XC-03` | Structure | Concern family | Product or system in use | Design principle | Does the product concentrate decisions, responsibilities, dependencies, authority, and complexity into coherent boundaries that preserve the qualities they are meant to support? |
| `XC-04` | Lifecycle integrity | Concern family | Engineering system | Engineering-system capability | Can relevant versions, changes, configurations, dependencies, builds, releases, migrations, and provenance remain identified, controlled, reproducible, and recoverable across the lifecycle? |
| `XC-05` | Risk | Concern family | Decision relationship | Threat | Are relevant faults, threats, hazards, misuse, sensitivities, interactions, and quality tradeoffs understood relative to declared tolerances? |
| `XC-06` | Assurance | Concern family | Assurance or evidence corpus | Assurance mechanism | Does a proportionate portfolio of verification and validation activities produce grounds for believing the applicable quality claims? |
| `XC-07` | Feedback | Concern family | Engineering system | Engineering-system capability | Can product behavior and effects be detected, interpreted, connected to decisions, and used to correct or improve the product and its governing assumptions? |
| `XC-08` | Evidence | Evaluation envelope | Assurance or evidence corpus | Evidence property | Is the evidence relevant, valid, representative, attributable, fresh, sufficiently complete, and explicit about uncertainty for the claim it supports? |

The names are stable labels, not compressed definitions. “Claim context” and
“Evidence” apply to every assessment. The six concern families are considered
only where applicable. None is an eleventh product-quality pillar, and none
receives a product-quality verdict in place of the ten pillars.

This separation follows a recurring pattern across authoritative sources:
product-quality models describe desired characteristics; requirements
frameworks connect needs to quality requirements; evaluation and measurement
frameworks govern how target entities are assessed; architecture-description
standards distinguish the entity from its representation; and assurance
standards connect claims to arguments and evidence.[^iso-25010][^iso-25030][^iso-25040][^iso-25020][^iso-42010][^iso-15026-1][^iso-15026-2]

## Classify by subject and role

Classify every future record on two independent axes before deciding whether
it belongs in this model.

### Assessment subjects

| Subject | What can be assessed |
| --- | --- |
| Product or system in use | Source, executable behavior, data, interfaces, and effects within declared scope |
| Supporting artifact | Requirement, contract, model, architecture description, test, runbook, or other representation |
| Engineering system | The capabilities used to construct, change, configure, deliver, operate, or learn from the product |
| Assurance or evidence corpus | The connected claims, arguments, activities, results, assumptions, and evidence used to justify judgments |
| Review activity | The protocol, perspective, procedure, model, reviewer, or tool performing an assessment |
| Context or environment | Stakeholders, goals, scenarios, dependencies, constraints, lifecycle stage, consequence, and operating conditions |
| Decision relationship | A threat, contribution, constraint, tradeoff, dependency, or evidentiary relationship among other entities |

Architecture guidance provides a useful precedent: the architecture of an
entity is distinct from an architecture description that expresses it, and
different concerns may require different viewpoints.[^iso-42010] The same
discipline prevents a good document, test suite, pipeline, or review process
from being mistaken for a good product.

### Conceptual roles

| Role | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Product-quality outcome | A desired quality of the software product; owned by one of the ten pillars |
| Subquality | A narrower dimension that constitutes part of a pillar |
| Supporting-artifact quality | A desired quality of a specification, test suite, model, or other supporting artifact |
| Design principle | A defeasible rule for shaping the product so it tends to preserve qualities |
| Engineering-system capability | A durable ability to construct, change, deliver, operate, or learn from the product |
| Assurance mechanism | An activity or control that produces grounds for a quality claim |
| Evidence property | A property that makes information fit or unfit to support a particular claim |
| Review protocol | A procedure for selecting scope, gathering evidence, judging, and reporting |
| Metric or measure | An operationalized observation intended to answer a stated information need |
| Heuristic | A fallible shortcut whose usefulness depends on context and calibration |
| Contextual condition | A fact that changes a claim's meaning, applicability, priority, or required confidence |
| Threat | A circumstance or event that can impair an outcome |
| Tradeoff | A relationship in which improving or preserving one concern can impair another |

Dependability research likewise separates desired attributes, impairments,
and the means used to attain confidence rather than flattening all three into
one list.[^dependability] Measurement standards start from information needs
and require attention to the validity of analysis results; a metric is not the
quality it is intended to indicate.[^iso-15939][^iso-25020]

## Admit only genuine cross-cutting records

A candidate belongs in this model only when it passes this gate:

1. **Different role:** it is not merely another name for a product pillar or
   one of its subqualities.
2. **Coherent kernel:** it has one stable semantic head, a bounded definition,
   and inclusion and exclusion rules.
3. **Explicit mechanism:** it can explain how it constrains, enables,
   contributes to, evidences, threatens, or trades off with a pillar.
4. **Material breadth:** it has material relationships to several pillars in
   meaningfully different quality domains, not repeated wording with no causal
   or evidentiary account.
5. **Non-reduction:** no single pillar can own the concern without hiding
   material relationships to other pillars.
6. **Independent assessability:** its own subject can receive a meaningful
   judgment without substituting for the verdict on a linked pillar.
7. **Portability:** its semantic kernel survives changes in technology,
   repository shape, lifecycle method, and review tool.
8. **Conditionality:** it can state when a relationship applies, does not
   apply, or cannot be judged.
9. **Evidence discipline:** it does not treat the presence of a mechanism,
   artifact, signal, or metric as proof of the outcome.
10. **Outcome orientation:** it can guide assessment without prescribing one
    universal implementation or inspection sequence.

Records must pass 1–5 and 7. Failure on 6, 8, 9, or 10 calls for revision or
placement as a contextual aid rather than a canonical concern. As a
provisional editorial check, require a candidate to show material links to at
least four pillars spanning at least three distinct quality domains. Test the
classification at thresholds of three and five during validation. This
numeric threshold is a design convention from this synthesis, not a rule
established by the cited sources.

Broad labels such as *trustworthiness*, *overall quality*, and *dependability*
fail the non-reduction test beside the ten pillars. Narrow outcomes such as
availability, testability, accessibility, modularity, and performance usually
belong under a pillar or one typed record. Named practices such as TDD, SOLID,
DRY, static analysis, logging, automation, and code review are mechanisms,
principles, or heuristics until a more precise outcome and subject are stated.
