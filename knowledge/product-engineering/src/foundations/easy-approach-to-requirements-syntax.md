# EARS: preconditions, triggers, and system responses

The Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax (EARS) is a small set of rules for
writing textual requirements. It keeps natural language but fixes the order of
a requirement's clauses and marks each kind of condition with a keyword:
*While* for a state, *When* for an event, *If … then* for unwanted behaviour,
and *Where* for an optional feature.[^mavin-ears-2009]

This explanation is for product, engineering, and quality readers who have met
EARS in a template, a tool, or an AI-assisted specification workflow and want to
judge what it contributes. After reading, you should be able to explain why EARS
orders its clauses as it does, distinguish its patterns and recognize when
choosing between them is a modeling judgment, identify requirements EARS
expresses poorly, and relate an EARS statement to requirement quality, authority,
and executable examples in this bundle.

## Where EARS came from

Alistair Mavin, Philip Wilkinson, Adrian Harwood, and Mark Novak developed EARS
at Rolls-Royce while extracting engine control system requirements from the
European Aviation Safety Agency's *Certification Specifications for Engines*,
section CS-E 50. That text had accumulated through incremental updates into long
paragraphs mixing explicit and implicit requirements with design guidance,
verification statements, and information. The engineers who would apply it were
mostly not trained in requirements definition.[^mavin-ears-2009]

The authors positioned EARS between unconstrained prose and other notations.
Formal notations such as Z and graphical notations such as SysML can add
precision, but translating stakeholder text into them can introduce errors,
create a language barrier with stakeholders, and require training. EARS took a
lighter route. The team started from loose rules of thumb that built on
Event-Condition-Action rules from active databases—*when* for events, *while*
for states, *if-then* for failures—and refined them as rewriting the source
text exposed cases they did not cover.[^mavin-ears-2009]

The paper states its own boundary. It concerns syntax; measures taken to improve
semantics are not described. It makes no claim that the approach suits every
level of system decomposition and calls it most suitable for high-level
stakeholder requirements.[^mavin-ears-2009]

## The problems it targets

The 2009 paper names eight problems that unconstrained natural language
introduces into requirements:[^mavin-ears-2009]

| Problem | What goes wrong |
| --- | --- |
| Ambiguity | A word, reference, or word order supports more than one reading |
| Vagueness | Precision, structure, or detail is missing |
| Complexity | Compound sub-clauses or interrelated statements share one requirement |
| Omission | A requirement is missing, particularly for unwanted behaviour |
| Duplication | Several requirements define the same need |
| Wordiness | More words are used than the requirement needs |
| Inappropriate implementation | The text says how to build the system rather than what it should do |
| Untestability | Satisfaction cannot be shown true or false in the implemented system |

It deliberately excluded conflicting requirements and missing traceability,
partly because they are not specific to natural language and partly because its
case study contained none. EARS therefore makes no direct claim about set-level
consistency.

## The generic form and why order matters

Every EARS requirement specializes one structure:

> *preconditions*, *trigger*, the *system name* shall *system response*

Mavin's current guide renders it as “While *optional precondition*, when
*optional trigger*, the *system name* shall *system response*” and states the
ruleset: zero or more preconditions, zero or one trigger, one system name, and
one or more system responses, always in that order.[^mavin-ears-site]

The order is not stylistic. The 2009 paper reads it as temporal logic:

1. The preconditions must hold, or the requirement can never become active.
2. The trigger must occur while those preconditions hold.
3. The system must produce the response if and only if both are
   satisfied.[^mavin-ears-2009]

That reading is what gives the syntax diagnostic force. An author who cannot
say which state applies, which event starts the obligation, or which subject
responds has found a gap in understanding rather than a wording problem.

EARS's terms map onto neighboring vocabularies without replacing them:

| EARS | ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148 | This bundle's [requirement template](../solution/requirements/authoring/requirement-template.md) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| System name | Subject of the requirement | Obligated subject |
| Preconditions and trigger | Conditions that make the obligation assessable | “Under condition or trigger” |
| Shall | The conventional binding keyword | A normative verb consistent with local policy |
| System response | What the subject does, or the constraint on it | One bounded outcome, limit, or prohibition |

## The five patterns

Each pattern below gives the author's template, the 2009 paper's engine example,
and an illustrative rewrite drawn from the fictional
[Northbank commitment specimens](../solution/requirements/authoring/northbank-commitment-requirements.md).
The Northbank rewrites show how the syntax behaves; they are not accepted
obligations, and the specimen table remains authoritative.

### Ubiquitous: always active

> The *system name* shall *system response*

A ubiquitous requirement has no precondition or trigger. The paper's example is
“The control system shall prevent engine overspeed.”[^mavin-ears-2009]

`NB-ALLOC-01` states that “an asset shall have no overlapping active allocations
or unexpired holds.” Its grammatical subject is the asset, which cannot be
obligated to do anything. EARS insists on naming a responding system:

> The allocation service shall prevent overlapping active allocations and
> unexpired holds for any asset in the controlled allocation scope.

Naming the subject is a real gain. It also exposes a limit discussed later: the
statement is an invariant over competing commands, and no single sentence
states the concurrency behavior that could falsify it.

### State-driven: *While*

> While *precondition(s)*, the *system name* shall *system response*

The response is required throughout a defined state. The paper's example is
“While the aircraft is in-flight, the control system shall maintain engine fuel
flow above XXlbs/sec.”[^mavin-ears-2009]

> While a hold is unexpired, the allocation service shall count the held asset
> as occupied for the hold's period.

### Event-driven: *When*

> When *trigger*, the *system name* shall *system response*

The response is required when an event is detected at the system boundary. The
paper's example is “When continuous ignition is commanded by the aircraft, the
control system shall switch on continuous ignition.”[^mavin-ears-2009]

> When an authorized replacement is committed, the allocation service shall
> preserve the reservation's identity, agreed period, price, and agreed
> capability constraints.

### Unwanted behaviour: *If … then*

> If *trigger*, then the *system name* shall *system response*

Unwanted behaviour covers failures, disturbances, deviations from desired user
behaviour, and unexpected behaviour of interacting systems. The authors gave it
distinct keywords because, in their experience, missing unwanted-behaviour
requirements were a major source of costly rework, and a separate form makes
those requirements findable throughout the life cycle. The paper's example is
“If the computed airspeed fault flag is set, then the control system shall use
modelled airspeed.”[^mavin-ears-2009]

> If replacement persistence is interrupted, then the allocation service shall
> preserve the prior assignment and allocation state.

### Optional feature: *Where*

> Where *feature is included*, the *system name* shall *system response*

The requirement applies only to products or configurations that include the
feature. The paper's example begins “Where the control system includes an
overspeed protection function…”[^mavin-ears-2009]

Northbank's partner-asset proposal shows the pattern's value for incomplete
work:

> Where partner-depot replacement is included, the allocation service shall
> *[hold-expiry and unknown-outcome response undecided]*.

The template makes the undecided response visible. It does not supply the
timeout Northbank has not chosen, and an author should not invent one to
complete the sentence.

## Combining keywords

Complex requirements combine keywords. The 2009 example is “While the aircraft
is on-ground, when reverse thrust is commanded, the control system shall enable
deployment of the thrust reverser.” The same event produces different required
responses in different states, and unwanted-behaviour requirements can nest
the other keywords: “While the aircraft is in-flight, if reverse thrust is
commanded, then the control system shall inhibit thrust reverser
deployment.”[^mavin-ears-2009]

Northbank's executable witness for `NB-REPLACE-01` has the same shape:

> While a reservation is assigned to an asset, if the replacement asset cannot
> be secured for the agreed period, then the allocation service shall report
> the conflict and retain the existing assignment.

Combination has a practical ceiling. Each added precondition lengthens the
sentence and multiplies the situations a reader must hold in mind. The paper's
own residual wordiness came from long requirements containing numerous
conditional clauses. When conditions start to accumulate, the rules usually
want a table.

## Judgments the syntax does not make

EARS asks authors to classify each requirement. Several of those classifications
depend on a modeling choice rather than on the requirement's wording.

**Wanted and unwanted behaviour are a viewpoint.** The paper's own footnote
observes that a redundant safety-critical subsystem accommodating a failure is
behaving normally, yet its requirements would be classed as unwanted behaviour.
The authors call the distinction “a matter of viewpoint, or even a matter of
‘style.’”[^mavin-ears-2009] The keyword choice should make recovery obligations
findable, not settle a debate about whether a situation is abnormal.

**Triggers and states can describe the same situation.** “When a hold expires”
is an event; “while a hold is expired” is a state. The event form obligates a
response at a moment; the state form obligates it for a duration. Choosing
between them decides whether a missed event still leaves the system obligated.

**EARS permits several responses.** The ruleset allows one or more system
responses, while ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148 expects each requirement to be
singular.[^iso-29148-explainer] The two need not conflict: the 29148 test is
whether the obligations could be decided and assessed independently. They do
conflict when authors split mechanically.

`NB-REPLACE-01` shows the danger. Replacement shall *either* secure the new
allocation and update the assignment together, *or* preserve the prior state.
It is tempting to write two EARS requirements:

> When a replacement allocation is secured, the allocation service shall update
> the reservation's assignment.
>
> If a replacement allocation cannot be secured, then the allocation service
> shall preserve the prior assignment and allocation state.

A system can satisfy both sentences and still violate the rule: it can update
the assignment, then fail while recording the allocation. The accepted
obligation is that no half-applied replacement is ever observable. That is an
invariant across a failure path, not a trigger and a response, and it belongs
with [authoring invariants and stateful behavior](../solution/requirements/authoring/authoring-invariants-and-stateful-behavior.md).

**A state can sometimes rescue an ordering rule.** `NB-MIGRATE-01` requires one
allocation writer *before* admitting replacement commands for a migrated
cohort. “Before” resists the patterns, but restating the rule as a state works:

> While a migrated cohort has more than one allocation writer, the allocation
> service shall reject replacement commands for that cohort.

The rewrite is not automatically equivalent. It must still be checked against
the source: it says nothing about preserving customer terms, which remains a
separate obligation in the same specimen.

## How the syntax has changed

Comparing the 2009 paper with Mavin's current guide shows refinement rather
than redesign:[^mavin-ears-2009][^mavin-ears-site]

| Aspect | RE'09 paper | Current guide |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Generic form | *optional preconditions* *optional trigger* the *system name* shall *system response* | While *optional precondition*, when *optional trigger*, the *system name* shall *system response* |
| Event-driven template | `WHEN <optional preconditions> <trigger>` | `When <trigger>`, with state preconditions carried by *While* |
| Readability alias | *During* permitted as an equivalent of *While* | Not listed |
| Examples | Aero engine control | Everyday products: phones, ATMs, laptops, cars, websites |
| Unwanted states | Future work: the authors suspected an additional template might be needed | Not listed as a separate pattern |

Separating the state keyword from the event keyword makes every precondition a
visible *While* clause. The broadening of examples matches the method's spread
beyond aerospace.

## Evidence and its limits

The 2009 case study rewrote 36 requirements extracted from CS-E 50, which the
team split into 47 EARS requirements while average length fell from 36.9 to
25.6 words. A cross-discipline team, including safety and airworthiness
engineers, classified each problem in the raw and rewritten sets. In that
sample, the rewritten requirements showed no instances of complexity, omission,
duplication, inappropriate implementation, or untestability, and fewer
instances of ambiguity, vagueness, and wordiness.[^mavin-ears-2009]

The authors qualified these results:

- Thirty-six source requirements is a small sample.
- Only high-level, safety-related requirements were studied; other kinds and
  lower levels might not fit the notation.
- Classifying vagueness is subjective and open to inconsistency.
- The apparent elimination of omission should be treated with caution: the
  rewrite identified some unwanted behaviour, but there was no evidence that
  other missing requirements had been found.
- Some requirements that did not fit were manipulated to fit, or the ruleset
  evolved to accommodate them.[^mavin-ears-2009]

The residual ambiguity came from preconditions understood by inference but not
recorded, and residual vagueness from high-level requirements awaiting design
decisions. Syntax could not supply knowledge the authors did not yet have.

Mavin's guide reports adoption by organizations including Airbus, Bosch, Dyson,
Honeywell, Intel, NASA, Rolls-Royce, and Siemens, and claims particular benefit
for authors whose first language is not English.[^mavin-ears-site] Adoption
lists show that practitioners find EARS worth using; they are not controlled
evidence that EARS improves outcomes. This explanation did not consult the
authors' later experience reports, listed under reading routes.

## Where EARS fits poorly

EARS constrains sentences, so it inherits the limits of sentences. The
[specification-method guide](../solution/requirements/authoring/selecting-a-specification-method.md)
already routes these needs elsewhere:[^selecting-method]

| Requirement shape | Why EARS strains | Better primary form |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Many interacting conditions | Each combination becomes another long sentence, and gaps between sentences are hard to see | Decision table or example table |
| Invariants across concurrency, retry, or partial failure | A single trigger and response cannot state what must never be observable | State model, transition table, or invariant |
| Idempotency and replay, as in `NB-REPLAY-01` | Identity, input equality, and retention windows stack as preconditions | Invariant with explicit scope, supported by examples |
| Data relationships, limits, and formulas | The response becomes a formula dressed as prose | Schema, table, or mathematical expression |
| Quality requirements measured over populations and windows | The condition is a measurement definition rather than a state or event | [Quantitative and quality requirements](../solution/requirements/authoring/authoring-quantitative-and-quality-requirements.md) |
| User goals and alternative paths | Individual obligations lose the scenario that connects them | [Use cases](use-cases.md), scenarios, or journeys |

Text and model can coexist. An EARS statement can name the obligation while a
linked table or model carries the rule combinations, provided the requirement
record says which representation is authoritative.

## EARS beside neighboring forms

**ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148 language criteria.** EARS is one way to satisfy the
standard's concern with unambiguous, singular, verifiable text, not a
replacement for its characteristics. A requirement can follow EARS perfectly
and still be unnecessary, infeasible, or incorrect.[^iso-29148-explainer] The
2009 paper's own rewrites use *shall not*, which 29148's drafting conventions
discourage; this bundle treats prohibition as an explicit normative force
rather than a grammar error.

**Given–When–Then examples.** EARS *When* and Gherkin *When* look alike but do
different jobs. An EARS requirement states a rule for every situation matching
its conditions. A Given–When–Then scenario illustrates one path with concrete
data. Northbank's `NB-REPLACE-01` witness is one example of the rule, not the
rule. [Designing executable specifications](../engineering/designing-executable-specifications.md)
owns when a rule earns an executable witness.

**User stories and use cases.** Stories and use cases express actor goals and
paths through an interaction. EARS statements can serve as the precise
obligations beneath them, including the unwanted-behaviour extensions that
scenarios often omit.

**Formal analysis.** EARS itself is informal: its semantics live in the prose
reading of its clauses. EARS-CTRL adds a glossary of controller terms and a
projectional editor so requirements are well formed by construction, then uses
controller synthesis to check whether a set of requirements can be realized as
a controller.[^ears-ctrl-2017] That is the direction to take when syntax alone
cannot establish consistency or realizability.

**AI-assisted specification tools.** Kiro's feature specs generate acceptance
criteria using the template “WHEN [condition/event] THE SYSTEM SHALL [expected
behavior],” citing clarity, testability, traceability, and
completeness.[^kiro-feature-specs] That is the event-driven pattern alone. A
workflow restricted to it has no distinct place for states, optional features,
or unwanted behaviour, which is where the 2009 authors located costly
omissions.

## What EARS does not settle

A well-formed EARS sentence is a candidate statement, not an accepted
obligation. Its keywords say nothing about who decided it, how binding it is,
whether its source supports it, or what evidence would show it is met. Those
remain the concerns of
[requirement authority and maturity](../solution/requirements/foundations/requirement-authority-and-maturity.md)
and [one authority, many witnesses](../solution/requirements/foundations/one-authority-many-witnesses.md).

## Failure modes

- **Template compliance as quality** — treating a sentence that fits a pattern
  as correct, necessary, or verified.
- **Hollow clauses** — filling *While* or *When* with a restatement of the
  response, or with a condition no one can observe.
- **Hidden unknowns** — inventing a trigger, state, or limit to complete the
  sentence instead of recording an open decision.
- **Mechanical splitting** — breaking an atomic rule into trigger–response
  pairs that can each pass while the intended rule fails.
- **Forced fit** — stacking preconditions where a table, model, or invariant
  would expose the rule.
- **Keyword substitution** — importing *shall* over a local normative
  convention, or treating *If … then* as proof that unwanted behaviour has been
  covered.
- **Event-only adoption** — using *When* for everything and losing the state,
  feature, and unwanted-behaviour distinctions that motivated the method.

## Reading routes and source basis

This explanation was prepared from the full text of the RE'09 paper and
Mavin's current EARS guide. The EARS-CTRL account relies on the paper's
published summary, and the Kiro account on its current documentation.
Northbank rewrites, the vocabulary mapping, and the comparisons with this
bundle are original synthesis.
