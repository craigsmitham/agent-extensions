# Product engineering update log

## 2026-09-09

- **Draft**: Added [Drucker's four disciplines of organizational renewal](foundations/drucker-organizational-renewal.md), a short explanation of abandonment, improvement, exploiting success, and innovation as parallel responsibilities. Included an illustrative library example, piloting as a method for testing changes, source attribution, and routes to product-engineering decisions. Updated Foundations and bundle discovery.

- **Integrate concepts**: Used the EPUB's surrounding discussions to integrate the seven tables into [Wardley mapping](foundations/wardley-mapping/wardley-mapping.md): key terms, component evolution, climatic patterns and method suitability, doctrine, learning recap, and situational-awareness reflection. Removed the separate book-figure reference and its discovery entry. Kept full source entries and qualifications, explained the climate/doctrine distinction, and omitted source highlighting that marked chapter coverage rather than priority. The integrated explainer meets the 500-line limit.

- **Markdown reference**: Replaced the seven book JPEGs in `foundations/wardley-mapping/wardley-book-figures.md` with a self-contained Markdown reference: six complete table transcriptions and a textual comparison of Figure 22's axes, gradients, and method suitability. Preserved qualifications, highlighted entries, and source attribution; updated the explainer and index previews.

- **Condense and organize**: Shortened [Wardley mapping](foundations/wardley-mapping/wardley-mapping.md) and grouped it with `foundations/wardley-mapping/wardley-book-figures.md` in a subject folder. Captured figures 10, 22, 27, 44, 60, 64, and 66 in full as original EPUB images and searchable tables, preserving source attribution, highlights, and the method gradients. Updated incoming links and added a local discovery index.

- **Draft**: Added [Wardley mapping](foundations/wardley-mapping/wardley-mapping.md), grounded in
  the December 2020 compilation of Simon Wardley's book. Developed map grammar,
  evolution, climate, doctrine, gameplay, and continuous learning through an
  illustrative rental scenario and an annotated map. Distinguished evolution
  from DDD strategic importance and model boundaries, connected the explanation
  to lifecycle decisions and JTBD, and updated Foundations, strategy, and bundle
  discovery. Preserved source attribution and the CC-BY-SA-4.0 license.

- **Rewrite**: Renamed the maintenance introduction to [Maintenance and the life of software products](maintenance/maintenance-and-the-life-of-software-products.md). Grounded the explanation in care, continuity, skilled attention, intervention, sustaining labor, and endings; connected those perspectives to software through attributed sources and a recurring illustrative invoice service. Updated discovery and inbound links.

## 2026-09-08

- **Draft**: Expanded [Jobs to Be Done](foundations/jobs-to-be-done.md) into a
  concept-led explanation with job-framing criteria, participant and scope
  distinctions, switching forces and timelines, job maps, desired outcomes,
  segmentation, research limits, and connections to product decisions. Wove the
  illustrative incident-coordination scenario throughout, retained the
  differences between traditions, and refreshed primary-source reading routes
  and the Foundations and What to solve previews.

- **Draft**: Added [How to maintain it](maintenance/) as the seventh lifecycle
  section, with [Maintenance and the life of software products](maintenance/maintenance-and-the-life-of-software-products.md) (originally titled Software maintenance as a craft).
  The introduction connects aging, comprehension, safe change, investment,
  modernization, compatibility, deprecation, and sustaining labor, with source
  attribution and an illustrative invoice-service scenario. Updated discovery,
  section tags, and the Engineering and Operations boundaries; detailed
  maintenance guides remain unwritten.

- **Draft**: Added [Domain-driven design](foundations/domain-driven-design.md)
  from primary online sources, covering shared language, subdomain
  classification criteria, bounded contexts and context mapping, tactical
  patterns, architecture relationships, and model evolution. Includes an
  illustrative rental scenario, two diagrams, explicit distinctions between
  contested interpretations, and reading routes. Linked it from Foundations
  and How to build it and refreshed the bundle's discovery summaries.

- **Draft**: Reworked [Jobs to Be Done](foundations/jobs-to-be-done.md) from
  primary online sources as a neutral comparison of progress and functional-job
  traditions, their research methods, the compatibility debate, and job stories.
  Added an illustrative software scenario and reading routes. Removed the prior
  adoption stance; this draft explains approaches without prescribing one.

- **Organization**: Added [Foundations](foundations/) as shared conceptual context
  alongside the six opinionated lifecycle sections. Moved
  `problem/jobs-to-be-done.md` to
  [Jobs to Be Done](foundations/jobs-to-be-done.md), updated its relative links
  and placement tag to `pe-foundations`, and linked it from What to solve.
  Updated the overview, discovery map, READMEs, and package description to
  distinguish shared explanations from guidance for lifecycle decisions.

- **Retirement**: Removed fifty-six files, roughly half the bundle: fifty-three
  concepts and three reserved subtree indexes. The decision followed an evidence
  review that scanned every repository on the maintainer's machine, this
  repository's own skills, packs, and rules, the bundle's link graph, and the
  session record. Nothing went for being wrong. What went was material that
  summarized a public source read better at the source, restated a sibling
  concept, or asserted a body of craft this bundle does not exercise. Sixty
  concepts remain across four sections. The five groups are recorded below with
  their file names, so a reader holding a link to a retired concept can find out
  where its claim went.
- **Convention**: A retired path is named in this log as a code span, never as a
  link. A link here resolves or it is not a link. The rule is retroactive: every
  historical entry that pointed at a path this change removed now names it in
  backticks, which keeps the record readable without handing a reader a route
  that 404s.
- **Retirement**: [Where to play](strategy/) lost all nine of its concepts and
  is now a scope-only index on the [How to run it](operations/) pattern. Gone
  are `strategy/strategy-as-choice.md`, `strategy/choice-cascade.md`,
  `strategy/advantage-and-coherence.md`, `strategy/strategy-as-hypothesis.md`,
  `strategy/value-creation-and-capture.md`, `strategy/wardley-mapping.md`,
  `strategy/developing-and-reviewing-wardley-maps.md`,
  `strategy/product-strategy.md`, and `strategy/overview.md`. Three claims were
  kept in the section index: the non-responsibilities list, the line that focus
  without an account of advantage is reduced scope, and the value stick with its
  Harvard Business School citation. The index now sends a reader to Martin,
  Wardley, and Harvard Business School directly, and states the admission test a
  future concept must pass — it must make an arena, advantage, or value-capture
  choice decidable in a way those sources leave open.
- **Retirement**: [What to solve](problem/) lost `problem/overview.md`,
  `problem/product-risks.md`,
  `problem/developing-value-and-demand-concepts.md`,
  `problem/empowered-product-teams.md`, and `problem/discovery-and-delivery.md`.
  The four product-risk questions and the claim that deciding what to solve is a
  loop rather than a sequence moved into the section index; the "Common failure"
  column of the authoring guide moved into [Value and demand
  model](problem/value-and-demand-model.md). Teams and cadence leave the bundle
  rather than move: the Placement entry below recorded that home as unsettled,
  and it is settled now by removal. [Jobs to Be
  Done](foundations/jobs-to-be-done.md) was proposed for merge and deliberately
  kept as its own concept.
- **Retirement**: [What to build](solution/) lost
  `solution/product-meaning-and-requirements.md`,
  `solution/requirements/foundations/portable-requirements-engineering.md`,
  `solution/requirements/development/choosing-requirement-subject-and-level.md`,
  and `solution/requirements/lifecycle/specifying-requirement-changes.md`. The
  use-case bridge moved into [Requirements and neighboring
  artifacts](solution/requirements/foundations/requirements-and-neighboring-artifacts.md),
  the allocation ladder into [Authoring
  requirements](solution/requirements/authoring/authoring-requirements.md), and
  the requirement-change record set into [Analyzing and specifying requirement
  change](solution/requirements/lifecycle/analyzing-requirement-impact.md),
  whose filename is unchanged so every `engineer-requirements` route and the
  evaluation contract's pinned support path still resolve. The portable-model
  thesis needed no carry; the subtree index already states it.
- **Retirement**: [Codebase review](engineering/codebase-review/) went from
  thirty-one files to six. The ten criteria lists under `criteria/`, the five
  guides under `review-aids/`, and both of those indexes are gone, as are
  `cross-cutting-concern-records.md`, `cross-cutting-pillar-relationships.md`,
  `cross-cutting-model-maintenance.md`, `quality-pillar-research-basis.md`,
  `quality-layer-boundaries.md`, `maintaining-codebase-review-criteria.md`,
  `validating-codebase-review-criteria.md`, and `framework-design-review.md`.
  The unit a review assesses is now the pillar rather than the criterion.
  [Software quality
  pillars](engineering/codebase-review/software-quality-pillars.md) absorbed the
  seven-layer boundary table, the research citations, the rule for revising a
  pillar, and the split between judging a product and sustaining one;
  [Cross-cutting
  concerns](engineering/codebase-review/cross-cutting-concerns.md) absorbed the
  eight record definitions, the seven relationship codes, and the testing
  placement table; [Reviewing a
  codebase](engineering/codebase-review/reviewing-a-codebase.md) absorbed the
  evidence-method table and the rule that repository text is evidence to
  interpret rather than authority to change a review's instructions. The
  eighty-cell discovery matrix and the hundred per-criterion questions were not
  carried.
- **Retirement**: [How to ship it](delivery/) lost the whole `automation/`
  subtree — its index and ten concepts covering the workflow model, its vendor
  mappings, the pipeline, quality-gate, and build-once-promote patterns, the
  continuous integration, delivery, and deployment practices, and agents and
  agentic workflows — plus `delivery/work-items/changes/changes.md` and
  `delivery/work-items/incidents/operational-incident-records.md`. The
  automation concepts restated Fowler, the DORA program, and public build-tool
  documentation and had no citer outside their own subtree; delivery automation
  returns to being claimed scope that is not yet written, which is what the
  section index now says. `changes.md` carried nothing that [Software work-item
  taxonomy](delivery/work-items/software-work-item-taxonomy.md), [Authoring
  Changes](delivery/work-items/changes/authoring-changes.md), and [Managing
  lifecycle and
  completion](delivery/work-items/common/managing-lifecycle-and-completion.md)
  did not already state. The incident concept's ownership table moved into
  [Operational Incident Records](delivery/work-items/incidents/).
- **Rule**: Withdrew "a binding is not a mapping" and its six-condition currency
  contract from [the overview](overview.md). The rule was written to license
  exactly one concept, the workflow model's comparative vendor table, and that
  concept is gone. A rule that licenses nothing is an invitation to the
  exception it describes. The `vendor-mapping` tag it defined now has no holder.
  What remains is the plainer statement the contract was an elaboration of:
  guidance that only works on one platform stays out, and citing a tool's
  documentation as evidence for a portable claim is not that.
- **Correction**: The [overview](overview.md) argued its own depth and facet
  rules entirely from `delivery/automation/`,
  `engineering/codebase-review/criteria/`, and
  `engineering/codebase-review/review-aids/`, all three of which this change
  removes. The rules now stand on subtrees that survive:
  [Requirements](solution/requirements/) divides by the activity a reader is
  engaged in and [Work items](delivery/work-items/) by the role a record plays,
  and form varies freely inside both. The agent-engineering boundary that the
  retired `agents-and-agentic-workflows.md` existed to mark is now stated in the
  overview itself, as a four-form table of who controls the meaningful next
  steps.
- **Correction**: The discovery map called Where to play and What to solve
  "complete for their scope". Those were the bundle's two least-used sections
  and carried its two most confident fullness claims. The map now says what each
  section holds rather than grading it, and states the pattern plainly: depth
  follows where material came from, not where it matters most.
- **Attribution**: Withdrew the credit to published Google SRE material, which
  no surviving concept cites. The Anthropic and OpenAI agent-engineering
  citations moved with the four-form table into [the overview](overview.md) and
  stay warranted, as do the DORA, ISO/IEC/IEEE, NIST, and build-tool citations,
  which all still have citing concepts. Roger L. Martin and Harvard Business
  School are now cited from a section index rather than from concept
  frontmatter, because OKF reserves `index.md` and `log.md`, and only the
  bundle-root `index.md` carries frontmatter; a section index cannot hold a
  `sources` entry. The notices say so rather than claiming every source is in
  provenance metadata.
- **Release**: Released as 2.0.0, one day after 1.0.0. Removing fifty-three
  concepts deletes public path space an installer may already link, so the major
  is not a courtesy. `axm knowledge concepts query --tag pe-strategy` now
  returns nothing where it returned eight concepts, which is a contract change
  even though no surviving claim changed meaning. The three packs that depend on this
  bundle raise their floor to `>=2.0.0`, because a pack resolving 1.0.0 would
  route a reader at files this version does not have.
- **Manifest**: Dropped the `workflow-automation`, `continuous-delivery`,
  `solution-concept`, and `interaction-design` keywords. No concept answers to
  any of them. `strategy` stays: the section still owns its question and its
  index still carries the value stick, and the bundle description still runs
  "from strategy through operations".
- **References**: Repointed the five surviving links that still named a removed
  file. Two Change references now cite [Software work-item
  taxonomy](delivery/work-items/software-work-item-taxonomy.md), which is where
  the role and the Bugfix classification are defined; the review-evidence row of
  [Preserving evidence and
  provenance](delivery/work-items/common/preserving-evidence-and-provenance.md)
  and the boundary sentences in [How to run it](operations/) and [Supporting
  quality criteria](engineering/codebase-review/supporting/) now cite the
  concepts that absorbed the material. Three of the five sit in files this
  change otherwise left alone; a link target is not a claim, and a protected
  file that routes to nothing is not protected.
- **Vocabulary**: The unit a review assesses is the pillar, and every section
  that names it now says so. [How to run it](operations/) named
  "codebase-review criteria" for the properties it sustains and now names
  `SQ-03`, `SQ-04`, and `SQ-06`; [How to build it](engineering/) and [Reviewing
  a codebase](engineering/codebase-review/reviewing-a-codebase.md) drop
  "criterion" where they meant a pillar. `TSQ-01` cited `EVO-05`, an identifier
  the criteria lists carried and nothing now defines, and cites `SQ-09`
  Evolvability instead. The `TSQ` identifiers keep the word `criterion` for
  themselves, because a supporting checklist item is not a pillar.
- **Attribution**: A carried claim keeps the citation that made it checkable,
  and a citation names an authority rather than a route. [Software quality
  pillars](engineering/codebase-review/software-quality-pillars.md) now cites in
  its body the ten research sources it inherited, in a synthesis paragraph that
  states which lesson came from which model instead of pointing at its own
  frontmatter. [Reviewing a
  codebase](engineering/codebase-review/reviewing-a-codebase.md) regained the
  NIST AI Risk Management Framework citation for the rule that model-assisted
  review rests on documented context, roles, limits, and measurement. [Value and
  demand model](problem/value-and-demand-model.md) dropped a `sources` entry
  that had been repointed at a section index: its neighboring-concerns sentence
  is a boundary claim and needed no authority. [Applying project-specific
  requirements
  policy](solution/requirements/adaptation/applying-project-specific-requirements-policy.md)
  cites [Requirement authority and
  maturity](solution/requirements/foundations/requirement-authority-and-maturity.md),
  the concept that states the model it layers over, in place of the subtree
  index.
- **Rule**: The section-tag rule said reserved indexes hold navigation rather
  than retrievable claims, which this change made false: the value stick, the
  four product risks, and the two owners of incident thresholds now live only in
  an index. [The overview](overview.md) admits it and bounds it. An index may
  state a claim; it may not state an obligation another file has to apply, and a
  claim a concept must cite as its authority is promoted into a tagged concept,
  so that nothing retrievable rests on something unretrievable.
- **Boundary**: [How to ship it](delivery/) regained the row its Boundaries
  table lost with the automation subtree: How to build it owns what a repository
  task means and who may invoke it, this section owns when a workflow runs it
  and what happens to the result. How to build it had been stating that split
  alone. The row's old second clause, which sent a reader to the automation
  subtree for the full statement, did not come back.
- **Routing**: Three surviving files send the product-meaning-to-requirement
  boundary to [What to build](solution/), which never named where the answer
  is. Its Requirements heading now names [Requirements and neighboring
  artifacts](solution/requirements/foundations/requirements-and-neighboring-artifacts.md),
  which is where the deleted `solution/product-meaning-and-requirements.md`
  landed.
- **Recovery**: Carried the decision history of the three bundles retired in
  this change into this log, one `Migrated history from the ...` section each,
  matching the sections already kept for `strategy`, `product-management`, and
  `requirements-engineering`. The three reserved logs were deleted with their
  bundles in the first pass. A corpus that records why a claim was set aside
  cannot discard the record of why a bundle was, so the entries return with
  their original dates and reasoning and with their links repointed at the
  concepts' new paths.
- **Correction**: Converted the ten root-absolute links in
  [Where to play](strategy/) to directory-relative links. The strategy
  migration entry below recorded that every bundle-root link resolved under
  `/strategy/`, which held only for a reader who reads a leading slash as this
  bundle's `src` root. Nothing else asks that: every other link in the bundle
  is directory-relative, and all ten targets are same-directory siblings. One
  rule now resolves every link here.
- **Correction**: [How to build it](engineering/) named the three review
  criteria its operations boundary is confused with as reliability, operational
  security, and cost. The criteria are Reliability, Security, and Efficiency,
  and the cost question sits inside Efficiency's envelope. Both sides of that
  boundary now use those three names.
- **Boundary**: How to build it states the engineering half of two divisions
  its neighbors state from theirs. [What to build](solution/) chooses the
  interaction and How to build it judges, on available evidence, whether the
  built result achieves it. The execution surface owns what a task means and
  who may invoke it; `delivery/automation/` owns when a
  workflow runs it and what happens to the result.
- **Discovery**: The [codebase review](engineering/codebase-review/) index now
  routes through its criteria, supporting, and review-aid indexes rather than
  only through their leaves. It was the only parent index in the bundle that
  skipped its child indexes, which left two of them reachable from concept
  prose alone. The direct links to the ten criteria lists stay, because a
  reader who already knows which outcome they are judging should not have to
  pass through a second index.
- **Routing**: `engineering/codebase-review/quality-layer-boundaries.md` sent
  findings to a contributor-guidance layer, a shared assurance layer, and
  optional method aids, none of which names a destination in the merged bundle.
  Method aids are the `engineering/codebase-review/review-aids/`,
  assurance and evidence are two of the eight cross-cutting records, and the
  engineering-system capabilities it lists now split across the execution
  surface, `delivery/automation/`, and
  [How to run it](operations/). Design principles are recorded as having no
  destination yet, because Architecture and technical design is still
  unwritten, rather than being pointed somewhere convenient.
- **Placement**: The Teams and cadence group in [What to solve](problem/) is
  marked as an unsettled home rather than quietly justified. Empowered product
  teams and Discovery and delivery describe who chooses and at what rhythm,
  which this section's question depends on without owning. No concept moved;
  relocating one across sections is a larger decision than a correction pass
  should take on its own.
- **Rule**: A binding is not a mapping. The overview said anything churning
  with a vendor lives elsewhere, and the migrated
  `delivery/automation/workflow-model-explainer.md` then
  restated the object models of several named platforms inside this bundle.
  The rule now separates a binding, which only works on one platform and stays
  out, from a dated comparative mapping that exists to make a portable claim
  checkable, which may stay under a six-condition currency contract. The
  alternative was deleting the table, which would have left the model's central
  claim asserted rather than checkable.
- **Structure**: Flattened `patterns/` and `practices/` in
  `delivery/automation/`. They were folders named for a knowledge
  form, which the facet rule forbids. The seven concepts now sit directly in
  the subtree and the grouping survives as index headings and concept tags,
  which is what that rule prescribes instead.
- **Rule**: Recorded the depth rule, sections ask and subtrees hold. Two
  subtrees are named for artifacts, which reads as artifact partitioning
  readmitted after the overview rejected it. It is not: artifact type fails as
  a partition because a reader at the top of the corpus would have to guess the
  artifact, and a reader who has reached a section has already chosen the
  question. The rule is stated with the two conditions that stop it becoming a
  loophole.
- **Correction**: The claim that knowledge form never earns a folder at any
  depth was too absolute to survive its own bundle.
  `engineering/codebase-review/criteria/` is uniformly checklists and
  `engineering/codebase-review/review-aids/` uniformly guides. The
  test is what a folder is named for, not what it turns out to contain, and the
  signal that form has become the partition is a sibling folder holding the
  same subject in another form.
- **Authority**: The definition of design had two identical copies, in the
  overview and in [What to build](solution/). The overview is now the
  definition of record because it defines design across all four altitudes;
  the section cites it. [How to run it](operations/) cited the section rather
  than the owner and now cites the owner.
- **Boundary**: The overview listed four things deliberately kept outside and
  the delivery indexes named a fifth. Agent engineering joins the table, which
  is the boundary
  `delivery/automation/agents-and-agentic-workflows.md`
  exists to mark.
- **Correction**: The section tag rule exempted reserved `index.md` and
  `log.md` files but not the bundle-root concept that states it. This overview
  belongs to no section and can carry no section tag, so the exemption now says
  so wherever the rule is described.
- **Correction**: Three counting claims contradicted the files. The README said
  five retired bundles where its own table named six, and said two sections
  carry more than one source where three do. The discovery map said four
  sections hold concepts where five do. In this log, the
  `requirements-engineering` migration was recorded as twenty-eight concepts
  and holds twenty-five, and the `product-management` migration as nine and
  holds ten, eight of which went to What to solve. Every count is now taken
  from the directories.
- **Migration**: Moved the thirty-eight concepts of the `software-engineering`
  bundle into [How to build it](engineering/) and retired that bundle. The
  `codebase-review/` tree moved intact with its criteria, review-aid, and
  supporting subfolders, and the eleven loose concepts landed at the section's
  top level, so every relative link still resolves. The section index replaces
  its planned-scope table with a status table naming Verification, Review and
  assessment, and Execution surface as populated, and Architecture and
  technical design and Construction as still unwritten.
- **Migration**: Moved the twenty-two concepts of the `work-management` bundle
  into a [work items](delivery/work-items/) subtree under
  [How to ship it](delivery/) and retired that bundle. The four role folders
  moved intact beneath the taxonomy, and the bundle index became the subtree
  index.
- **Decision**: The operational incident record contract stays with work
  items; [How to run it](operations/) owns the response. The two are different
  obligations that happen to share a word. A record contract says what an
  incident record must contain, who it identifies, and how its identity
  survives revision, which is the same craft as a Defect Report and belongs
  beside it. A response regime says what threshold convenes a response, who
  holds it, how severity escalates, and who may declare it closed, which is
  production reality and belongs to the section that owns production. The
  incident concept now delegates the response regime explicitly rather than
  leaving the split implied.
- **Migration**: Moved the ten concepts of the `workflow-automation` bundle
  into an `delivery/automation/` subtree under
  [How to ship it](delivery/) and retired that bundle. The pattern and practice
  subfolders moved intact, and a new subtree index states what the subtree
  owns.
- **Decision**: Migrated workflow automation whole rather than taking only its
  continuous integration and delivery practices. Those practices are the part
  of the field this section reaches for, but they rest on the common workflow
  model, the vendor mappings, and the structural patterns, and a section that
  kept the conclusions and discarded their basis would state rules it could not
  justify. The provisioning, data-processing, operational, and durable
  application-flow profiles stay in scope for the same reason: they are the
  field this section borrows from, not stray material. Agents and agentic
  workflows migrated with them as the boundary marker it was written to be, so
  the subtree still says plainly where its own field stops and agent
  engineering begins.
- **Retirement**: Removed the `learning/` section, leaving six questions rather
  than seven. The reasoning is recorded in [the overview](overview.md), which
  now names the owner of every clause of the retired question. In short, the
  section never found content it could own: two of its planned areas restated
  the `knowledge-management` bundle, one restated `field-notes`, one was never
  written, and the single clause that was genuinely product engineering already
  belonged to [What to solve](problem/). A section that is nothing but routing
  to other bundles fails this bundle's own placement test.
- **Convention**: Every concept file now carries one section tag matching its
  directory: `pe-strategy`, `pe-problem`, `pe-solution`, `pe-engineering`,
  `pe-delivery`, and `pe-operations`. Reserved `index.md` and `log.md` files
  carry none.
- **Decision**: The tag convention exists because bundle is the only retrieval
  scope a query can name. `axm knowledge concepts query --bundle` filters to a
  whole bundle and there is no folder filter, so retiring six bundles into this
  one would have destroyed a scoping level readers were relying on. The tags
  restore it as a facet rather than as structure, which is the rule this bundle
  already applies to design.
- **Release**: Released as 1.0.0 rather than continuing the 0.x line. Pack
  consumers are being asked to swap a mature `software-engineering` 2.8.1
  dependency for this bundle, and a 0.x version would understate the stability
  of what they are receiving. The three packs that pointed at retired bundles
  now depend on `@craigsmitham/knowledge/product-engineering` at `>=1.0.0`.
- **Migration**: Moved the twenty-five concepts of the `requirements-engineering`
  bundle into [What to build](solution/) and retired that bundle. The six
  subsections moved intact under a [Requirements](solution/requirements/)
  subtree, so every relative link between them still resolves and no concept
  was rewritten. The bundle root index became the subtree index, restated as
  what the subtree owns rather than what a bundle covers.
- **Decision**: Kept the subsections rather than flattening them into the
  section. The `product-management` migration flattened `value-and-demand/`
  because a sub-index competing with the section index split discovery for no
  gain at that size; twenty-eight concepts invert that judgment, and a flat
  section would bury the design concepts still to be written among them.
- **Structure**: The subtree also carries the seam. What to build now holds
  both epistemologies its planned scope named — appetite-bounded exploration at
  the section's top level, statements that must survive verification under
  Requirements — and the folder boundary keeps the difference visible without
  promoting it to a boundary between sections.
- **Decision**: Retired `requirements-engineering` rather than keeping it beside
  this bundle, on the `product-management` precedent: two bundles owning
  elicitation, specification, review, and traceability is the contradiction
  this corpus exists to avoid. The cost was known and accepted — that bundle
  was pack-bound rather than standalone, so
  `@craigsmitham/packs/requirements-engineering` and the
  `engineer-requirements` skill were repointed at this bundle as part of the
  move.
- **Correction**: Superseded the earlier Deferred entry, which recorded
  `requirements-engineering` as still supplying this section. Both bundles it
  named have now migrated; only the design areas remain unsourced.
- **Migration**: Moved the ten concepts of the standalone `product-management`
  bundle into this one and retired that bundle. Eight went to
  [What to solve](problem/), Product strategy to [Where to play](strategy/),
  and Product meaning and requirements to [What to build](solution/). The
  problem section index replaces its planned-scope table with the migrated
  concepts.
- **Decision**: Retired `product-management` rather than keeping it beside this
  bundle. Its four content areas were the four planned areas of What to solve,
  so keeping both would have left two bundles owning outcomes, risk, and
  discovery, which is the contradiction this corpus is meant to avoid. The
  discipline survives as a topic, not as a section identity; sections are named
  for questions, not for the people who answer them.
- **Decision**: Product strategy sits in Where to play, not What to solve. It
  is the rung of the choice cascade that turns an arena choice into product
  direction, and it reads as strategy work rather than problem selection. The
  section intro now says it owns that translation, and What to solve begins
  where a team picks problems inside the resulting direction.
- **Decision**: Product meaning and requirements moved to What to build,
  because its subject is where product meaning stops and a normative statement
  begins, and this bundle gives the requirement to the section that owns the
  commitment to form. What to solve links to it rather than holding it.
- **Structure**: Flattened the `value-and-demand/` subfolder into
  [What to solve](problem/). A sub-index competing with the section index
  splits discovery for no gain at this size; the subfolder's framing paragraph
  became the section's Value and demand heading.
- **Rename**: "Product management overview" became Product decisions and
  accountability. Its list of how
  product work connects was a second telling of the seven questions, so it now
  describes the loop this section holds and names the neighbors that own the
  rest.
- **Attribution**: Rewrote the source entries that pointed at
  `product-management` paths or at this bundle by URL, so in-bundle references
  are relative, and normalized the "Strategy — ..." reference titles left from
  the strategy migration to "Where to play — ...".
- **Boundary**: Discovery and delivery stays in What to solve as the pair of
  work a product team joins. The mechanics of release belong to How to ship it
  and production health to How to run it; the problem section index says so.
- **Restructure**: Split the problem and solution questions apart and gave
  design a home. `product/` became `problem/` ("What to solve") and
  `requirements/` became `solution/` ("What to build"). No concepts moved;
  both sections were still scope-only.
- **Decision**: "What it must do" was retired as a section identity. Naming a
  section for the requirement made it artifact-shaped, which this bundle's own
  organizing argument rejects, and its question was unanswerable on its own
  terms: what a product must do cannot be stated without having chosen a
  solution concept. The requirement survives as a concept the section owns —
  the form a design choice takes once it must be disputed, traced, and
  verified.
- **Decision**: Design is defined once, in [What to build](solution/), as
  choosing the form a solution will take at a deliberate resolution from
  alternatives genuinely considered, plus the record of that choice. The test
  "a statement becomes design the moment it constrains form" is what separates
  What to solve from What to build.
- **Decision**: Design is not a section. It recurs at four altitudes —
  solution concept, interaction, technical, operational — and sections own
  altitudes rather than the word. This is the facets-not-folders rule applied
  to an activity. It also resolves a collision: "Design and architecture" under
  How to build it was renamed "Architecture and technical design" so the word
  no longer names two different things in two sections.
- **Decision**: An eight-section scheme giving design its own question was
  considered and set aside. It manufactures a design-then-requirements handoff
  that the sources deny, and forces an arbitrary ruling on concepts that are
  genuinely both, such as appetite and breadboarding.
- **Seam**: Redrawn. The earlier note pointed at a design-against-requirements
  split, which would have reinstated the handoff the decision above rejects.
  The real fault line in [What to build](solution/) runs between
  appetite-bounded exploration — rough, noncommittal, cheap to discard — and
  statements that must survive being disputed, traced, and continuously
  verified. The two halves of the section's planned scope already fall on
  either side of it, four areas each. Nothing forces a split at this size, and
  the section now documents the seam rather than the log merely promising it.
- **Amendment**: What to build owns the exploration as well as the commitment.
  Its opening named only the commitment to form, which reads as the convergent
  end of a funnel whose value lies in the alternatives generated and set aside.
  The section now claims the search across candidate forms and the alternatives
  discarded, on Buxton's account of what a sketch is for.
- **Amendment**: Added the asymmetry beside the reciprocity claim. "Not a
  handoff" established that technical design sends a commitment back, which is
  correct but reads as though the two sections were peers. Getting the right
  concept precedes getting the concept right, and the cost of change rises with
  fidelity; that is why What to build precedes How to build it in the value
  stream rather than merely sitting beside it.
- **Correction**: Dropped "and the record of what was chosen" from the
  definition of design in both [the overview](overview.md) and
  [What to build](solution/). The cited basis does not support it — sketches
  are disposable and a shaped concept is deliberately unfinished — and the
  clause let the artifact stand in for the choice. What the clause was doing is
  carried instead by the requirement paragraph that already follows the
  definition in both files, and What to build adds the positive claim: what
  survives is the choice, not the artifact that carried it.
- **Naming**: "What to build" moved from the problem section to the solution
  section because that is what the phrase means in practice, and the problem
  section became "What to solve". All seven titles now share one grammatical
  form. Judgment lives in the question, not the title, following the precedent
  already set by "Where to play".
- **Basis**: Ryan Singer on shaping as primarily design work, on requirements
  as chosen rather than real, on appetite as a design input, and on hill charts
  placing uphill figuring-out inside every scope rather than in a phase of its
  own; Bill Buxton on getting the right design before getting the design right,
  on sketches asking rather than telling, on sketches as plentiful and
  disposable, and on design preceding engineering; Nielsen Norman
  Group on the problem-space boundary of discovery, and on process frameworks
  as scaffolding for managing risk rather than as stages.
- **Boundary**: Usability stays in What to solve as a risk that evidence
  retires; the craft of designing for it belongs to What to build. Both section
  indexes say so, and both state that the What to build / How to build it pair
  is a division of questions, not a handoff.
- **Deferred**: No content migrated. `product-management` and
  `requirements-engineering` still supply their sections; the solution concept,
  fidelity, and interaction design areas of What to build have no source bundle
  and will be written from scratch. (Superseded: both bundles have since
  migrated and been retired.)
- **Initialization**: Created the bundle skeleton as seven sections, one per
  practitioner question, with a root discovery map and a section index for
  each. No concepts yet; existing bundles migrate in later changes.
- **Decision**: Documentation craft stays in the separate `docs` bundle rather
  than becoming a section here. Expressing knowledge for a reader is its own
  discipline, and it applies well beyond product engineering.
- **Decision**: `knowledge-management` and `field-notes` are not recorded as
  migration sources for How to learn. The section scope stands as intent;
  sourcing is deferred until those bundles have a clearer purpose.
  (Superseded: How to learn has since been retired and its `learning/`
  directory removed, so the deferral no longer has a subject.)
- **Migration**: Moved the eight concepts of the standalone `strategy` bundle
  into [Where to play](strategy/) and retired that bundle. The section index
  replaces its planned-scope table with the migrated concepts, and every
  bundle-root link now resolves under `/strategy/`.
- **Decision**: Widened the section's first area from "Participation and
  advantage" to "Participation, advantage, and value" so Value creation and
  capture has a home. Value capture is part of how an arena is won, not a
  separate question.
- **Attribution**: Repointed the two `product-management` source entries that
  cited the retired bundle at their new location, and corrected the footnote
  text that named the Strategy bundle as owner.

### Migrated history from the `strategy` bundle

- **2026-09-08 — Attribution**: Resolved every declared-but-uncited source by
  footnoting the specific claims each one supports in Strategy overview, The
  choice cascade, Advantage and coherence, Value creation and capture, and
  Strategy as hypothesis.
- **2026-09-08 — Discovery**: Rewrote the description of Developing and
  reviewing Wardley maps to pair its supported outcome with the situation that
  selects it, and matched the index entry.
- **2026-09-08 — Navigation**: Added related-concept links so a reader arriving
  by search can reach neighboring concepts without returning to the index.
- **2026-08-29 — Ownership**: Re-established Wardley Mapping as portable
  strategy guidance, separating situational awareness from strategic choice.
- **2026-08-21 — Migration**: Removed Wardley mapping after its canonical
  ownership moved to the architecture collection.
- **2026-08-20 — Strategic mapping**: Added a Wardley mapping draft connecting
  user need, value-chain visibility, evolution, movement, inertia, action, and
  explicit review of strategic hypotheses.

### Migrated history from the `product-management` bundle

- **2026-09-08 — Discovery**: The bundle root routed to the Value and demand
  section instead of flattening its four concepts alongside it, and stated the
  bundle's boundaries. That section index said what it owned and what the rest
  of the bundle covered.
- **2026-09-08 — Attribution**: Cited the previously declared but unreferenced
  SVPG sources in the product management overview, Outcomes and evidence,
  Discovery and delivery, Product risks, and Empowered product teams.
- **2026-09-08 — Navigation**: In-bundle footnote references gained linked
  titles, and Jobs to Be Done and Value and demand model linked to their
  neighbors so a concept reached by search could reach the rest.
- **2026-08-29 — Value and demand model**: Added portable Offering, Audience,
  Need, Job to Be Done, and Value Proposition concepts, with authoring guidance
  and a boundary between product meaning, behavioral views, requirements,
  realization, and evidence. Tracker form, stage eligibility, controlled
  cross-artifact relationships, and architecture-specific classification stayed
  outside the bundle.

### Migrated history from the `requirements-engineering` bundle

- **2026-09-08 — Update**: Gave every action-oriented concept, the thirteen
  Guides and two Checklists, a selection condition in its `description`, so a
  search result or index entry stated both the supported outcome and the
  observable situation that made the concept relevant. Concept bodies were not
  changed.
- **2026-09-08 — Update**: Rewrote each section index entry to match the
  revised frontmatter descriptions exactly, and clarified the section
  introductions in Authoring, Review, Lifecycle, and Adaptation to describe
  their contents rather than call every member a guide.
- **2026-09-08 — Update**: Regrouped the bundle root index so the first group
  name covered both the Foundations and Development sections it listed, and
  made each section entry say how that section differed from its siblings.
- **2026-09-08 — Correction**: Fixed the `sources` title in Mapping to
  requirements hosts to match the cited concept's actual title, One authority,
  many witnesses.
- **2026-08-29 — Creation**: Established a method-neutral requirements
  engineering model covering elicitation, analysis, specification, review,
  traceability, change, and local adaptation.

### Migrated history from the `software-engineering` bundle

- **2026-09-08 — Coverage and time wording corrected**: In [Designing executable
  specifications](engineering/designing-executable-specifications.md),
  supporting coverage now checks additional cases and properties rather than
  establishing correctness, which examples and coverage alike cannot do alone;
  and the refund example no longer treats time of day and time zone as
  incidental, since they can determine entitlement until the rule settles
  whether the window uses elapsed time or calendar days, its governing time
  zone, and endpoint inclusion.
- **2026-09-08 — Executable specifications revised**: Reworked [Designing
  executable specifications](engineering/designing-executable-specifications.md)
  after external review. Exclusions are now framed around what is incidental to
  the obligation rather than categories of content, so protocol, storage, and
  ordering details may be the rule itself; a rule, its examples, and supporting
  coverage are distinguished by authority; decisive boundary examples stay in
  the readable text while exhaustive sweeps sit below it; the four layers are
  presented as separable responsibilities rather than mandatory abstractions;
  and characterization is defined by inferring intent from behavior, not by when
  the text was written.
- **2026-09-08 — Split**: Moved lifecycle guidance into [Keeping specifications
  authoritative](engineering/keeping-specifications-authoritative.md), which
  separates acceptance from verification, covers manual, static, and
  deployment-dependent obligations, failure triage, retirement, and generated
  change. The split kept the designing guide under the repository's 300-line
  limit.
- **2026-09-08 — Lifecycle**: Marked both specification guides stable after
  review of the revised text, so their OKF lifecycle state identifies them as
  ready for consumption. As elsewhere in that bundle, no `verified` event is
  recorded: the guides remain generated content whose consequential claims
  should be confirmed against their cited sources.
- **2026-09-08 — Restructure**: Split every concept that exceeded the
  repository's 300-line limit into reader-recognizable siblings, preserving all
  content. The cross-cutting model became four concepts ([the model and
  admission gate](engineering/codebase-review/cross-cutting-concerns.md),
  `engineering/codebase-review/cross-cutting-concern-records.md`,
  `engineering/codebase-review/cross-cutting-pillar-relationships.md`, and
  `engineering/codebase-review/cross-cutting-model-maintenance.md`); the pillar
  taxonomy became three ([the
  pillars](engineering/codebase-review/software-quality-pillars.md),
  `engineering/codebase-review/quality-layer-boundaries.md`, and
  `engineering/codebase-review/quality-pillar-research-basis.md`); criteria
  maintenance separated from
  `engineering/codebase-review/validating-codebase-review-criteria.md`;
  the [task interface](engineering/repository-task-interface.md) separated from
  [resolved contract
  principles](engineering/resolved-task-contract-principles.md), [invocation and
  conformance
  principles](engineering/task-invocation-and-conformance-principles.md), and
  [adoption](engineering/adopting-a-repository-task-interface.md); and the two
  test-level guides separated their admission gates from [operating
  cross-boundary suites](engineering/operating-cross-boundary-test-suites.md)
  and [writing browser test
  evidence](engineering/writing-browser-test-evidence.md). Content that
  originated in the earlier `codex/gpt-5.6` generations was carried over
  unchanged in substance; the new files record that reorganization under
  `claude/opus-5`.
- **2026-09-08 — Discovery**: Regrouped the bundle index around test-level
  choice, building and operating admitted tests, and specification authority,
  and regrouped the codebase-review index around running a review, the
  quality-outcome taxonomy, the cross-cutting model, and collection evolution.
  Every concept was listed with its exact frontmatter description.
- **2026-09-08 — References**: Repointed the ten product-quality criteria lists
  and [Reviewing a
  codebase](engineering/codebase-review/reviewing-a-codebase.md) at the concepts
  that now own record definitions and typed pillar relationships.
- **2026-09-08 — Executable specifications**: Added [Designing executable
  specifications](engineering/designing-executable-specifications.md), which
  separates authority and audience from test level: admission gates for which
  rules earn a specification, BRIEF-derived rules for the specification text, an
  explicit exclusion table, a worked before-and-after example, four-layer
  separation of text from automation, notation neutrality with property-based,
  contract, and formal neighbors, lifecycle guidance, and specification as the
  acceptance surface for generated change. It was a draft generated from public
  sources that had not yet completed source reconciliation.
- **2026-09-08 — Boundaries**: Distinguished an executable specification from a
  contract suite. Comprehensive coverage of a consumer-facing interface and
  authority over a decided rule are separate properties; the narrow-test guide
  keeps "contract suite", and the new guide keeps "specification". Also
  distinguished specifications from characterization and approval tests, which
  assert actual rather than intended behavior.
- **2026-09-08 — Routing**: The three test-level guides began routing by
  authority as well as by level, and the bundle index stated that levels and
  authority are separate axes.
- **2026-09-02 — Narrow tests**: Added [Choosing the narrowest effective
  test](engineering/choosing-the-narrowest-effective-test.md) as the narrow end
  of the test-architecture ladder: deliberate admission, one assertion home,
  explicit-seam substitution, consumer-facing contract suites, and keeping
  repository conventions out of test runners. The cross-boundary guide already
  routed to "the narrower test architecture"; this concept is that route. It was
  a draft generated from repository-local guidance and public sources that had
  not yet completed source reconciliation.
- **2026-09-02 — Lifecycle**: Marked the cross-boundary and browser-dependent
  testing guides stable after completing their source reconciliation, so their
  OKF lifecycle state identifies them as ready for consumption without claiming
  a human verification event.
- **2026-09-02 — Test architecture**: Added [Designing cross-boundary and
  end-to-end
  tests](engineering/designing-cross-boundary-and-end-to-end-tests.md),
  separating claim scope, boundary reality, execution distance, and observation
  technology so browser use no longer defines end-to-end scope.
- **2026-09-02 — Interface testing**: Added [Choosing browser-dependent
  interface tests](engineering/choosing-browser-dependent-interface-tests.md),
  with a browser-risk admission gate, focused scope and matrix selection,
  semantic assertions, visual evidence, bounded accessibility conclusions, and
  failure diagnostics.
- **2026-09-02 — Source review**: Reconciled the testing guides against current
  official Nx, Playwright, Cypress, Selenium, Testing Library, Storybook, jsdom,
  ASP.NET Core, Spring, Rails, W3C WAI, Google, ISTQB, Test Desiderata, and
  established broad-stack testing guidance, plus empirical UI-flakiness
  research.
- **2026-09-02 — Task interface**: Renamed Command execution strategy to
  [Designing a coherent repository task
  interface](engineering/repository-task-interface.md), made its developer,
  agent, automation, and maintenance outcomes explicit, and recast task graphs
  and script boundaries as means to discoverable, safe, and trustworthy
  repository work.
- **2026-09-02 — Execution contract**: Added outcome-based target ownership and
  naming, declared-dependency and single-inventory rules, bounded alias and
  composite semantics, behavior-based cache guidance, explicit bootstrap
  boundaries, executable conformance, and a stepwise adoption workflow.
- **2026-09-02 — Source review**: Revised the task-interface model against
  official Nx, Turborepo, Gradle, Bazel, Buck2, Pants, moon, and just guidance
  plus primary build-systems literature. Replaced graph-target canonicality with
  one resolved semantic contract, added portable operation and selection terms,
  typed dependencies, launcher and host boundaries, cache trust and freshness
  semantics, behavioral conformance, and observable outcome signals.
- **2026-09-01 — Packaging**: Added `@craigsmitham/packs/software-engineering`
  as an optional recommended pack, installing only that standalone bundle.
  (Superseded: the pack now depends on this bundle.)
- **2026-09-01 — Refactor**: Replaced the active topic-based review set with ten
  product-quality criteria lists for Suitability, Correctness, Reliability,
  Security, Safety, Efficiency, Usability, Compatibility, Evolvability, and
  Intelligibility. Each list contains ten stable-ID outcome questions with
  rationale, applicability, nearest-neighbor boundaries, sources, and
  list-level cross-cutting relationships.
- **2026-09-01 — Separation**: Added [Test-suite quality
  criteria](engineering/codebase-review/supporting/test-suite-quality.md) as a
  supporting-artifact assessment. Product testability remains under
  Evolvability, while Assurance and Evidence retain the evidence-to-product
  relationship.
- **2026-09-01 — Review aids**: Added optional repository-evidence,
  scenario-analysis, verification-evidence, runtime-investigation, and
  model-assisted-review guides so inspection methods remain discoverable without
  entering the timeless outcome criteria.
- **2026-09-01 — Design review**: Added
  `engineering/codebase-review/framework-design-review.md`, covering structural
  checks, six synthetic product forms, seven boundary challenges, design
  revisions, and unresolved risks. The result supports comparative trials, not
  a claim of field validation.
- **2026-09-01 — Replacement**: Removed the former ten topic checklists once the
  new framework was complete. The collection intentionally carries no redirect,
  deprecated-stub, legacy-ID, or backward-compatibility layer.
- **2026-09-01 — Research**: Added [Cross-cutting concerns for software
  quality](engineering/codebase-review/cross-cutting-concerns.md), a typed model
  with Claim context and Evidence as assessment envelopes around six singular
  concern families: Specification, Structure, Lifecycle integrity, Risk,
  Assurance, and Feedback. It defines a cross-cutting admission gate, explicit
  relationship types, a concern-by-pillar map, precise placement for testing and
  testability, and a comparative validation plan.
- **2026-09-01 — Research**: Added [Software quality
  pillars](engineering/codebase-review/software-quality-pillars.md), a
  research-grounded candidate taxonomy of ten singular product-quality outcomes.
  It defines the assessed entity and outcome layer, records boundary tests and
  alternatives, and treats the then-current ten topics as migration evidence
  rather than a preservation constraint.
- **2026-09-01 — Methodology**: Separated product-quality outcomes from
  subqualities, design principles, engineering-system enablers, assurance
  mechanisms, and evidence contracts before refactoring the remaining
  checklists.
- **2026-09-01 — Research**: Added Test Desiderata and pstack as practitioner
  datapoints. Distinguished test-suite quality from product testability and
  product quality, and classified pstack's principles, review methods, assurance
  practices, and code-shape heuristics without promoting them into product
  pillars.
- **2026-09-01 — Creation**: Added
  `engineering/codebase-review/maintaining-codebase-review-criteria.md` to keep
  durable quality outcomes separate from optional evidence, perspective, and
  inspection-method aids as the collection evolves.
- **2026-09-01 — Pilot**: Converted the then-current Testing and verification
  quality criteria into ten stable-ID, outcome-centered questions with explicit
  rationales as the collection's first vertical slice, then design-reviewed it
  against synthetic library, service, multi-package workspace, and interrupted-
  review scenarios.
- **2026-09-01 — Protocol**: Refocused [Reviewing a
  codebase](engineering/codebase-review/reviewing-a-codebase.md) on reviewer
  use, added non-lossy assessment states and evidence fields, and routed
  checklist design, validation, and retirement to the maintenance guide.
- **2026-08-31 — Expansion**: Broadened the bundle from execution-surface
  engineering to include [codebase review](engineering/codebase-review/) while
  preserving the exclusions for change methods, requirements and architecture
  lifecycle, work items, documentation craft, and language or framework
  references.
- **2026-08-31 — Creation**: Added [Reviewing a
  codebase](engineering/codebase-review/reviewing-a-codebase.md) and ten
  source-traced, `reporting-review` checklists for correctness, testing, module
  and API design, workspace configuration, code clarity, data contracts,
  dependencies, security, reliability, and performance.
- **2026-08-31 — Lifecycle**: Marked the review collection as source-reviewed
  candidates, not field-validated controls, and documented comparison,
  reviewer-agreement, misselection, false-completion, and retirement signals.
- **2026-08-29 — Creation**: Re-established the bundle at a new scope, portable
  execution-surface engineering craft, after retiring its v1.1.0 design-change
  and work-item scope. Added Command execution strategy, renamed in v2.3.0 to
  [Designing a coherent repository task
  interface](engineering/repository-task-interface.md).

### Migrated history from the `work-management` bundle

- **2026-09-08 — Update**: Removed dangling conversion references to unnamed
  "earlier" material from [Software work-item
  taxonomy](delivery/work-items/software-work-item-taxonomy.md), [Work-item
  content contract](delivery/work-items/common/work-item-content-contract.md),
  [Preserving evidence and
  provenance](delivery/work-items/common/preserving-evidence-and-provenance.md),
  [Maintaining work-item identity and
  relationships](delivery/work-items/common/maintaining-identity-and-relationships.md),
  [Mapping work items to native
  hosts](delivery/work-items/common/mapping-to-work-item-hosts.md), [Authoring
  Changes](delivery/work-items/changes/authoring-changes.md), and [Recording
  Defect Reports](delivery/work-items/defects/recording-defect-reports.md),
  replacing each with orienting content the reader can act on.
- **2026-09-08 — Update**: Linked the three role explanations and the content
  contract to the [Software work-item
  taxonomy](delivery/work-items/software-work-item-taxonomy.md) so a reader who
  arrives by search can reach the defining reference.
- **2026-09-08 — Update**: Normalized Defect and Operational Incident Record as
  the portable role terms across descriptions, index entries, and the content
  contract, matching usage already established in the concept bodies.
- **2026-09-08 — Update**: Sharpened the bundle root index introduction and its
  common-section entry to state the cross-role grouping principle rather than
  list concepts. That index is now the [Work items](delivery/work-items/)
  subtree index.
- **2026-08-29 — Creation**: Established the portable work-item taxonomy, common
  content contract, Defect Report, Change, and Operational Incident Record
  guidance, and tracker-neutral templates. Bodies generated by `codex/gpt-5.6`.

### Migrated history from the `workflow-automation` bundle

- **2026-09-08 — Practice boundaries**: Finished the 2026-08-21 split by
  removing the deployment, release, and exposure vocabulary and the "not
  universally preferable" argument duplicated between
  `delivery/automation/continuous-deployment-explainer.md` and
  `delivery/automation/continuous-integration-delivery-and-deployment.md`.
  The reference now solely owns the comparative vocabulary, the explainer solely
  owns adoption rationale, and each links to the other.
- **2026-09-08 — Discovery**: Added `Related` sections to
  `delivery/automation/agents-and-agentic-workflows.md` and the
  practice-comparison reference, which were the only concepts offering a search
  reader no route onward.
- **2026-09-08 — Index**: Merged the two single-entry groups in the bundle root
  index into one Patterns and practices group. That index is now the
  `delivery/automation/` subtree index.
- **2026-08-21 — Practice boundaries**: Added
  `delivery/automation/continuous-integration-delivery-and-deployment.md` as the
  comparative authority for the three practices and removed the duplicated
  delivery-versus-deployment section from the focused delivery explainer.
- **2026-08-14 — Agent boundary**: Distinguished deterministic automation, LLM
  workflows, agents, and agents contained within workflows; retained schedules,
  dependencies, durable progress, retries, cancellation, and compensation in
  workflow automation.
- **2026-08-08 — Creation**: Established the workflow automation model, vendor
  mappings, initial patterns (pipeline, quality gate, build once and promote),
  and initial practices (continuous integration, continuous delivery, and
  continuous deployment).
