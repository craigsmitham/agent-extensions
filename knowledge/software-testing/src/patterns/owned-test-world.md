# Owned test worlds

## Problem and forces

A spanning test can fail without an accountable owner, leave state that poisons
later runs, or report a retry as though no failure occurred. Larger worlds need
representative state and observable readiness while remaining independently
selectable, diagnosable, and recoverable after interruption.

## Response

Give the test world one semantic owner, explicit lifecycle responsibilities,
and execution and evidence contracts tied to the decision it supports.
[Evidence-matched test world](evidence-matched-test-world.md) owns the choice of
real and substituted boundaries.

## Ownership

Project layout should reflect evidence ownership and lifecycle:

| Placement | Use when |
| --- | --- |
| **Collocated with the subject** | The framework-native harness is part of that subject's normal build and dependency context, with no independent orchestration or release concern. |
| **Complementary project for one deployable** | The harness has distinct dependencies, configuration, tasks, artifacts, or runtime lifecycle and primarily verifies one application. |
| **Feature-owned project or suite** | A large deployable has stable feature ownership and independent selection needs that are proven by scale, not anticipated. |
| **Cross-system project** | The claim spans deployables or teams and has an explicit owner responsible for the whole journey and its failures. |

Start with one complementary project per deployable when a distinct harness is
warranted. Split only when ownership, dependency boundaries, selection, or
execution scaling has become independently meaningful. Keep browser, device,
environment, or authentication variations in the runner's configuration unless
they truly have different semantic owners.

Nx's frontend templates illustrate the complementary-project pattern with an
application and a sibling E2E project, while its Playwright integration can
also configure an existing project. Playwright projects represent repeated
configurations and subsets within a harness. These are useful examples of the
distinction between **repository project ownership** and **test-runner matrix**,
not universal folder requirements.[^nx-react-template][^nx-playwright][^playwright-projects]

Give every spanning test one diagnosis owner even when several teams must help
repair the product. Cross-boundary tests without clear ownership tend to rot
because no single component owner can interpret the whole failure path.[^google-larger-testing]

## State and lifecycle

The lifecycle identifies the exact system, environment, identity, seed state,
readiness condition, stimulus, public consequence, diagnostic capture, and
resource cleanup. Readiness must be observable. Cleanup includes interruption,
not only the successful end of a test.

Prefer setup through stable domain or support APIs when their behavior belongs
to the scenario. Direct seeding is appropriate when it shortens setup without
erasing a boundary the claim depends on. Make generated identities unique and
record the seed or case identity needed to reproduce a failure.

Tests should not depend on the outcome of earlier tests. An intentionally
ordered workflow can live in one scenario or declare its sequence explicitly;
splitting it into order-dependent test cases creates misleading selection and
parallelism semantics. Rails, Google, and browser-framework guidance all expose
the same tradeoff: broader user workflows are valuable, but they cost more to
run, isolate, and maintain.[^rails-testing][^google-larger-testing]

Do not rely exclusively on teardown after success. Namespace test data,
constrain mutations, make cleanup idempotent, and plan for interruption so a
crashed worker does not poison later executions.

## Define execution and evidence semantics

Place each suite at the earliest decision point its world can faithfully
support:

| Decision point | Suitable evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Local change | Fast, isolated worlds with focused selection and useful local diagnosis |
| Change review | Representative cross-boundary claims affected by the change |
| Post-merge | Wider or slower worlds whose delay does not invalidate submission feedback |
| Pre-deployment | Built-artifact, configuration, and isolated-deployment claims |
| Post-deployment | Non-destructive probes and observations that only the live environment can answer |

Bind the suite to a repository task whose inputs, dependencies, environment,
freshness, artifacts, and meaning of success are explicit.

A retry is another observation, not proof that the first failure was harmless.
Preserve attempt-level results and distinguish product failure, test defect,
environment failure, and unknown. At large scale, flaky signals consume
diagnostic attention and train teams to ignore legitimate failures.[^flaky-tests-google]

## Make failure attributable

On failure, retain the smallest safe evidence set that reconstructs the path:

- test identity, claim, case data, and seed;
- source, built artifact, deployment, and configuration identities;
- dependency and substitute versions;
- structured request, response, message, exit-status, or domain-event facts;
- lifecycle and readiness failures;
- logs and correlation identifiers from every owned boundary; and
- browser traces, screenshots, or console/network evidence when a browser is
  the observer.

Do not collect secrets, unbounded production data, or opaque bodies merely
because they might help. Prefer structured, redacted, attributable diagnostics
designed with the system.

## Consequences and evidence

Explicit ownership and isolation improve attribution and repeatability at the
cost of harness and cleanup work. Shared environments limit destructive control
and early feedback; a fixture cannot promise isolation beyond the state it
actually owns. The cited practices support this draft synthesis; the Northbank
case is illustrative, not field validation of the pattern.
