# Evidence-matched test world

## Problem, context, and forces

A test can pass while removing the condition that would falsify its claim.
Broader execution can restore fidelity while increasing cost, instability, and
diagnostic ambiguity. The useful choice balances fidelity, speed, isolation,
specificity, and predictiveness.[^google-unit-testing][^google-larger-testing][^test-desiderata]

## Response

Choose the smallest world that preserves every distinction material to the
claim and exposes a plausible contrary condition. The result serves a bounded
decision and risk, including failure, interruption, or recovery where relevant.
Risk-based effort reflects likelihood and impact, not automatic broad coverage
for every change.[^istqb-risk]

A changed file, route, declaration, or document does not itself need a new test.
Consumer-visible behavior and distinct regression risks justify evidence. A
second level earns its cost by covering a different risk. Executable
specifications address readable rules, examples, and evidence independently of
execution level; see [Executable specifications](executable-specifications.md).

## Separate the dimensions

Testing labels are overloaded. Do not infer scope from the runner or directory
name. These independent dimensions describe what a result can establish:

| Dimension | Question | Example values |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Claim scope** | What behavior and causal path does the result cover? | One function, component, application, workflow, multi-service journey |
| **Boundary reality** | Which production boundaries remain real? | In-process dispatch, real serialization, live database, real subprocess, substituted third party |
| **Execution distance** | How is the system obtained? | Imported module, framework test host, local processes, installed artifact, isolated deployment, shared environment |
| **Observation and control** | How is it driven and observed? | Direct call, HTTP client, message client, CLI, browser, external probe, human evaluation |

This yields combinations that names alone often hide:

| | Narrow claim scope | Broad claim scope |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Non-browser observer** | A module or adapter test | An API-, CLI-, worker-, or message-driven system test |
| **Browser observer** | A component, rendering, or interaction test | A browser-driven cross-boundary journey |

A browser test is therefore not necessarily end-to-end. Conversely, a test can
exercise most of a system through a service or command interface without using
a browser. Broad-stack testing is a continuum, and its UI is only one possible
entrypoint.[^broad-stack-test]

Use **end-to-end** only with a declared start and a declared end. “From the public
HTTP request through persistence,” “from the installed command through its
output artifact,” and “from browser navigation through the application-owned
backend” are meaningful scopes. “Tests everything” is not.

## Material boundaries

A causal path from stimulus to observable consequence can cross these boundaries:

| Boundary | Distinctions a cheaper world might erase |
| --- | --- |
| Framework dispatch | Routing, middleware order, binding, validation, filters, error mapping |
| Serialization or protocol | Wire names, encoding, headers, status, framing, compatibility |
| Process lifecycle | Startup, shutdown, signals, environment, working directory, readiness |
| Persistent store | Real schema, transactions, constraints, queries, locking, migrations |
| Asynchronous work | Scheduling, acknowledgment, retry, ordering, eventual visibility |
| Service integration | Authentication, protocol contract, timeout, partial failure, version skew |
| Built or installed artifact | Packaging, omitted files, executable permissions, resolution, runtime dependencies |
| Deployment | Configuration binding, routing, identity, platform limits, asset and network behavior |

Retain a boundary only when its real behavior is necessary to discriminate the
claim. Replace the rest deliberately. A double is useful when its behavior is
understood and checked against the real collaborator; an unvalidated double can
make a test confidently green against an invented contract.[^google-test-doubles]

## Representative worlds

Choose a world by the distinctions it preserves:

| Test world | Preserves | Commonly omits |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Direct or composed in-process execution | Application logic and selected real collaborators | Host lifecycle, transport, packaging, deployment |
| Framework-native test host | Framework wiring, dispatch, rendering or serialization | Real server/container and network behavior |
| Live local process set | Process startup, real transport, local services | Installed/deployed topology and shared-platform behavior |
| Built or installed artifact | Packaging and runtime resolution | Deployment control plane and production topology |
| Isolated deployment | Deployment configuration and realistic topology | Shared traffic and production-only integrations |
| Shared staging or production observation | Actual shared environment | Hermeticity, early feedback, safe destructive control |

Framework-native tests are not “less real” in the abstract. ASP.NET Core can
bootstrap the application with an in-memory test server, and Spring MockMvc can
exercise framework request handling without a live server; each preserves
substantial behavior while omitting specific host and network distinctions.
Those omissions determine whether the world fits the claim.[^aspnet-integration][^spring-mockmvc]

If two worlds answer different risks, keep both. Do not make the broadest world
repeat all detailed cases already proved more specifically; use a small number
of representative cross-boundary examples to establish the integration claim.

## Substitution contract

For each dependency, record:

- whether it is real, fake, simulated, recorded, or unavailable;
- which behavior the substitute must preserve;
- how compatibility with the real dependency is checked;
- which failures the world can and cannot reveal; and
- who owns drift between the substitute and reality.

Prefer a controlled local or isolated instance for application-owned
dependencies when their implementation matters. Prefer a substitute plus
contract evidence for third-party systems unless the decision genuinely needs
a safe provider-owned test environment. Broad tests against uncontrolled third
parties commonly add latency and instability without creating accountable
evidence.[^practical-test-pyramid][^google-larger-testing]

## Observation and control

Choose the surface that exposes the user- or consumer-visible claim while
preserving the necessary path:

- public API or protocol for service behavior;
- command invocation and resulting output, state, and exit status for a CLI;
- message publication and observable downstream effect for an asynchronous
  workflow;
- browser interaction for browser-dependent consequences; or
- an external probe for a deployed availability or routing claim.

Use internal probes only when the claim itself is internal or when they provide
diagnostic evidence without replacing the public outcome. A test that drives a
public surface but proves success only through private state can miss a broken
consumer-visible response.

## Narrow tests and contract suites

Write a unit test when logic can be exercised with plain inputs and observed
through return values, emitted events, or calls on an explicit collaborator.
Skip a direct unit test for route-local composition, static copy, declarative
configuration, or a wrapper that adds no behavior. Those subjects are proved by
the composed contract they participate in or by a type or build check.

### Contract suites

Use a dedicated suite when it is the comprehensive contract promised to a
consumer. Organize it by capabilities and observable outcomes, so a reader can
tell which promise a failing case breaks. When one interface has several
implementations, write the contract once as a shared suite and run it against
each implementation. A shared suite is what keeps an in-memory implementation
honest against the real one.[^fowler-contract-test]

### Narrow integration tests

Keep one boundary real and substitute the rest. Use the repository's declared
test store, migrations, and fixtures rather than an ad hoc schema, and drive
the subject through its public interface. Give the test its own uniquely
identifiable data so it can run in any order and be cleaned up after
interruption.

## Substitute through explicit seams

Supply clocks, identifiers, clients, repositories, filesystems, and other
capabilities through the same service or function boundaries production uses.
Prefer a small contract-faithful fake over module interception, global
patching, call-count assertions, or mocking a large import graph. The substitution contract above applies to these seams.[^google-test-doubles][^fowler-test-double]

Signs that a substitution has gone wrong:

- the test asserts how many times a collaborator was called rather than what
  the subject produced;
- the substituted module is the one whose behavior the claim is about;
- the same fake is re-declared in many files with drifting behavior; or
- production has no seam and the test reaches in through the module system.

When a seam is missing, add it to the subject rather than to the test.

## Keep conventions out of tests

Do not use a test runner to scan source files, Markdown, exports, directories,
workflow definitions, or package metadata for required or forbidden structure.
Mechanically decidable conventions belong in lint rules, repository quality
scripts, schema validation, typechecking, or build checks. Those tools report
the violation where it occurs, run in the right decision point, and do not
inflate a behavioral suite with structural ceremony.

## Consequences and related patterns

A narrower world often improves speed and diagnosis; every removed boundary is
also an evidence limit. A broader world is warranted when it restores a material
distinction. Review changed claims, dependencies, deployments, ownership,
runtime, and flakiness for lost or redundant evidence. A test whose claim has
disappeared or can no longer be discriminated has no coverage value merely by
remaining in the suite.

[Browser test evidence](../writing-browser-test-evidence.md) distinguishes
browser capability from subject scope. [Owned test worlds](owned-test-world.md)
addresses state, readiness, interruption, cleanup, execution, and diagnosis.

## Evidence and example

This draft pattern consolidates the cited test-design guidance; it is not a
field validation of the formulation. In Northbank's allocation case (shared
concept: `@craigsmitham/knowledge/software-engineering-foundations#cases/northbank-allocation-change`),
plain comparisons need no browser, while competing commits need a real-store
observer. A sequential fake erases the decisive condition. A separate world
can interrupt publication after commit and redeliver to an idempotent consumer;
a provider emulator does not establish the real provider's availability or
transaction guarantees.
