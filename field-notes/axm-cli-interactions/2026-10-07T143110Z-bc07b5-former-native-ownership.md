# Storage recovery encounters former native ownership proofs

## Context
Update the committed workspace to AXM 0.42.0 source-addressed storage and lockfile format 11.

## Friction
After preserving the unsupported lockfile, bundled-skill installation refused native artifacts that point at the former package address. The former native link no longer supplied ownership for the new destination.

## Cost / impact
Recovery required preserving former native artifacts outside the workspace, rebuilding external acceptance, explicitly adopting affected instruction regions, and then reconciling again.

## Outcome
The original artifacts and lockfile were preserved outside the workspace. AXM regenerated package storage and native projections. The resulting workspace passed lint and a sync preview with fail-on-change.

## Evidence
AXM 0.42.0 returned `bundled-axm-skill-native-artifact` and `Managed region source ownership conflicts`. Explicit instruction adoption and reconciliation subsequently completed.
