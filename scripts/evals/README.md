# Agent Skill evaluation runner

This repository runner validates first-party Agent Skill evaluation source and
executes declared routing and activated-execution cases through a replaceable
adapter. It writes generated evidence under the ignored `.work/evals/` tree.
It does not promote, audit, or approve a result.

Validate every first-party suite:

```sh
node scripts/evals/agent-skill-eval.mjs validate
```

Run selected cases with the included Codex adapter:

```sh
node scripts/evals/agent-skill-eval.mjs run \
  --package .axm/extensions/@craigsmitham/skills/author-docs \
  --adapter scripts/evals/adapters/codex.mjs \
  --host codex-cli \
  --model <exact-model-id> \
  --configuration-id <configuration-id> \
  --catalog-id <catalog-id> \
  --authority-policy-id read-only \
  --sandbox-mode read-only \
  --case-author-id <case-author-id> \
  --runner-id <runner-id> \
  --reviewer-id <reviewer-id> \
  --grader-id <grader-id> \
  --evidence-class authoring-smoke \
  --case 1,6
```

The runner automatically copies each path declared by
`environment.support_paths` in the evaluation contract into the same location
in the disposable workspace. Pass repeatable `--support-path` values only for
additional, run-specific inputs.

Use `--case` more than once or pass comma-separated case IDs. Other options
include `--trials`, `--run-id`, `--output-root`, `--baseline`, `--timeout-ms`,
`--token-budget`, `--cost-budget-usd`, and `--independence`.

Use `--sandbox-mode workspace-write` only for a case whose declared task
authority requires local artifacts. The Codex adapter provisions a disposable
AXM project before such a trial; the generated workspace is deleted after the
response and its reported side effects are retained. Grading remains read-only.

The Codex adapter starts a fresh temporary workspace and process for each trial
and grader call. Routing trials see only catalog names and descriptions.
Execution trials receive the target runtime payload, declared support paths,
and declared fixture contents. The adapter removes the temporary workspace
after preserving transcripts, responses, changed task-artifact contents,
grades, timing, and adapter logs in the run directory. Text artifact evidence
is bounded and may be marked truncated; binary content is described but not
embedded.

## Adapter contract

An adapter is an executable invoked as either:

```text
<adapter> trial <request.json> <trial-directory>
<adapter> grade <grader-request.json> <trial-directory>
```

`trial` writes `response.json`. A routing response contains `selected`,
`reason`, and `side_effects`; `selected` is one skill name or an ordered array
when the task requires composed skills. An execution response contains
`final_response` and `side_effects`. `grade` writes `grade.json` with an
outcome, failure class, per-assertion results, evidence, and detail. A nonzero
exit or missing output is recorded as `harness-error`.

One same-author run is authoring smoke even when every case passes. Release
evidence additionally requires a clean Git-bound target, exact identities,
the contract's repeated trials and cohort, calibrated grading, reviewable raw
evidence, and independent review. The runner enforces some of these conditions;
the evaluation contract and decision authority remain controlling.
