# Skill boundaries and neighboring elements

Use the element whose primary job matches the responsibility. A skill may use
neighboring elements; it should not absorb their authority merely because they
can be placed in the same directory or plugin.

| Element | Primary job | Boundary from a skill |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Agent definition or configuration | Define a goal-directed actor's role, tools, memory, authority, coordination, and control policy | Owns the actor and its behavior rather than one reusable job |
| Instruction file or rule | Establish always-on invariants and routes | Applies before a task-specific workflow is selected |
| Knowledge document | Supply facts, explanation, or reference | Informs cognition without owning an end-to-end procedure |
| Prompt or stored command | Start or shape one invocation | Need not be implicitly discoverable or reusable as a capability |
| Tool or MCP server | Provide an action or observation primitive | Exposes capability but not the surrounding judgment and completion flow |
| Script | Execute deterministic mechanics | Cannot own the full contextual workflow |
| Subagent | Configure a delegated actor, tools, or context | Defines an actor or isolation boundary rather than one reusable job |
| Hook | React automatically to a lifecycle event | Is event-driven rather than selected for a user goal |
| Extension manager | Own canonical packages, manifests, projections, composition, installation, and distribution lifecycle | Manages the skill artifact without owning its workflow semantics |
| Extension pack | Declare a capability set and dependency graph for coordinated installation and lifecycle | Is a composition contract, not itself the procedure |
| Agent plugin | Distribute host-native capabilities in one host-specific container | Is a host package boundary and is not interchangeable with an extension-manager pack |

## Selection rules

- Use a skill for one repeatable job with recognizable triggers and a coherent
  outcome.
- Use an agent definition when the durable artifact is an actor with a role,
  authority, tools, state, coordination, and stopping policy.
- Use an instruction for an invariant that must apply before the job is known.
- Use knowledge when the user needs understanding or lookup rather than a
  procedure.
- Use code when mechanics must be exact and cheaply testable.
- Use a subagent when separate context, authority, or actor specialization is
  the point.

Combining elements is normal. Incidental coupling—depending on whatever happens
to be installed on the author's machine—is not.
