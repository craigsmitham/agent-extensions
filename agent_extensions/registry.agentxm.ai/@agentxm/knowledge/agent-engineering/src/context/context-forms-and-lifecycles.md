# Context forms and lifecycles

“Context” groups information with different authorities, audiences, costs, and
lifetimes. Treating it as one store produces stale authority and accidental
retention.

| Form | Primary job | Typical owner | Lifecycle signal |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Persistent guidance | Shape decisions across a known scope | Instruction or policy surface | Scope or policy changes |
| Task context | State current goal, constraints, and acceptance | Request, issue, case, or plan | Task completes or changes |
| Retrieved knowledge | Supply relevant detail on demand | Canonical knowledge or documentation | Source revision or expiry |
| Observed environment | Describe current external state | Tool, file, API, UI, log, metric | Observation becomes stale |
| Feedback | Report consequence, failure, or verification | Check, review, test, or monitor | Next action consumes it |
| Working state | Preserve decisions, progress, and open loops | Plan, ledger, checkpoint | Work advances or hands off |
| Compressed history | Carry selected prior interaction forward | Compaction or summary artifact | Recompact or supersede |
| Personal preference | Shape interaction across tasks | User-controlled preference store | User revises or revokes |

## Ownership rules

- Persistent instructions should not become a task backlog.
- Conversation history should not be the only durable record of accepted
  decisions or externally meaningful state.
- Retrieved text does not become authoritative merely because it entered the
  context window.
- Tool output should identify observation time and relevant source identity.
- Feedback should preserve the evidence and recovery information needed for the
  next decision, not every raw byte that produced it.
- Compaction must distinguish accepted facts, tentative inference, completed
  work, unresolved questions, and superseded state.

Each form needs an explicit route into attention and a retirement condition.
Without both, context systems accumulate plausible but ownerless information.
