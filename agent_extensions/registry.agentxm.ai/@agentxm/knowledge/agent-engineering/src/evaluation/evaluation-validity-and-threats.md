# Evaluation validity and threats

| Threat | Control |
| --- | --- |
| Wrong construct | Trace every metric and grader to the decision and real success condition. |
| Unrepresentative cases | Sample from deployment conditions and document missing populations. |
| Uninformative task difficulty | Size cases so the measured behavior can vary; work the system already completes unaided cannot demonstrate selection, value, or a boundary. |
| Non-discriminating measures | Compare each measure across configurations; a check that passes everywhere reports coverage rather than evidence. |
| Leakage or contamination | Separate development and held-out cases; restrict hidden fixtures and graders. Treat any suite iterated against until it passes as a tuning set. |
| Environment mismatch | Match production tools, authority, state, limits, and failure conditions closely enough for the claim. |
| Correlated trials | Reset state and identify shared infrastructure or simulator dependencies. |
| Grader bias or drift | Calibrate, version, slice, inspect disagreement, and rerun stable calibration cases. |
| Ambiguous or broken tasks | Require fair specifications, known solutions, and transcript review. |
| Gaming and Goodhart effects | Keep critical measures plural, inspect surprising wins, and harden graders against bypasses. |
| Evaluator conflict | Use independent review proportional to consequence and separate author claims from approval. |
| Saturation | Move solved capability cases into regressions and introduce harder representative work. |

NIST calls for construct validation, representative data, measurement under
deployment-like conditions, independent assessors, and evaluation of the TEVV
process itself.[^nist-rmf] Anthropic recommends reading traces because apparent
target failures often come from tasks, graders, environments, or harness
constraints.[^anthropic-evals]

Evaluate the evaluation: can known good and bad examples produce fair grades,
can qualified reviewers reproduce the disposition, and would changing an
irrelevant surface change the result?
