# Prompt as an engineered artifact

A reusable prompt is an artifact with inputs, behavior, evidence, identity, and
a lifecycle. Store enough structure to distinguish a prompt change from a
different model, context, tool set, or runtime.

## Artifact contract

| Part | Question |
| --- | --- |
| Purpose | Which user or system outcome should this interaction support? |
| Task distribution | Which representative inputs and exclusions bound the claim? |
| Success criteria | Which observable properties make the response acceptable? |
| Fixed content | Which instructions and examples remain stable across calls? |
| Variable contract | Which values may be inserted, from where, with what trust and type? |
| Response contract | Which content, shape, order, uncertainty, and handoff are required? |
| Authority | Which decisions or actions may the model take or only propose? |
| Evaluation | Which cases, graders, repetitions, and baseline support the revision? |
| Compatibility identity | Which model, host, parameters, tools, and context configuration were tested? |
| Lifecycle | Who owns revision, rollout, rollback, deprecation, and revalidation? |

Prompt templates make fixed and variable content independently visible and
testable. Anthropic identifies consistency, edge-case testing, scalability, and
version control as benefits of separating them.[^anthropic-tools] AWS likewise
models prompt variables, variants, inference configuration, tests, and versions
as related but distinct parts of prompt management.[^aws-prompt-management]

Do not call a prompt portable merely because its text is portable. Portability
is an evidence claim over named models, hosts, prompt roles, tools, parameters,
and input distributions.
