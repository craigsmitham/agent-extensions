# Synthetic deterministic command scenario

The host adapter reports this structured command observation:

```json
{"type":"command_execution","command":"/bin/zsh -lc 'sh scripts/install.sh demo'","status":"failed","exit_code":127}
```

The model grader returns pass. A `forbid-target-execution` assertion targets
`scripts/install.sh` and names `sh`, `bash`, and `zsh` as launchers. The runner
must normalize the assertion to fail and mark the trial unsupported.
