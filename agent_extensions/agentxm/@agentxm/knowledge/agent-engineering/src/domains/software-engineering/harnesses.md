# Software engineering harnesses

A **coding harness** is an agent harness specialized for software engineering.
The term names a recognizable **application-domain profile**, not a deployment
size. It usefully covers a coding agent launched in a local repository, an
isolated worker producing a pull request in the background, or the coding-
agent harnesses participating in a larger coordinated system.

What makes each one a coding harness is not its size or location. It is the
combination of a software-engineering goal, an agent runtime, a working
environment, and the context and feedback needed to change software reliably.

## One domain, several scales

```text
local assistant
    → isolated task worker
        → remote background agent
            → coding-agent platform or distributed system
```

At the small end, a harness may be an agent loop, shell and editing
tools, repository instructions, and the developer's existing environment. At
larger scales, several harnesses may participate in a platform that provisions
remote machines, isolates branches, brokers credentials, schedules dependent
tasks, persists state, collects logs and test artifacts, and integrates results
with issue and review systems.

These are differences in interaction mode, execution location, continuity,
coordination, and operational responsibility—not different application
domains. The Codex SDK and App Server illustrate reusable coding-agent
facilities that can be embedded behind different interfaces and orchestration
arrangements.[^openai-codex-sdk][^openai-app-server] Current scaffold research
also treats coding systems as compositions whose control flow, memory, tools,
coordination, and verification vary independently.[^scaffold-taxonomy]

## Repository harnesses compose with coding-agent harnesses

The repository is not the whole coding-agent system, but it can own a
first-class **repository harness** that composes with portable coding-agent
runtimes and external infrastructure. The repository is usually:

- a **working environment** containing code and versioned artifacts; and
- a **context source** containing structure, instructions, documentation,
  examples, plans, and history; and
- an **adaptation owner** for commands, checks, policies, and other surfaces
  that make this codebase workable by agents.

This repository-owned layer is broader than repository context and narrower
than the complete system. A remote coding-agent system may also depend on
worker images, queues, sandboxes, credential brokers, network policies,
caches, browsers, observability services, and pull-request automation.

See [Repository harnesses](repository-harnesses.md) for its contents, ownership
boundary, nesting, and composition with agent hosts and organization policy.

## Coding-harness concerns

| Concern | Representative design questions |
| --- | --- |
| Task specification | Is the issue actionable, bounded, and verifiable? |
| Repository context | Can the agent find architecture, conventions, owners, and canonical examples without loading everything? |
| Code navigation | Can it search symbols, dependencies, history, and related changes efficiently? |
| Development environment | Can it install, build, run, and debug the software reproducibly? |
| Change isolation | Does each task have an appropriate branch, worktree, container, or VM? |
| Feedback | Can the agent read tests, compiler output, logs, metrics, UI state, and review findings? |
| Task continuity | Can work survive context compression, interruption, retry, or worker replacement? |
| Authority | Which files, repositories, services, credentials, and deployment actions are permitted? |
| Delivery integration | How do changes enter review, CI, merge, rollout, and recovery workflows? |

Remote agents make these concerns more visible because the developer's machine
and tacit knowledge are absent. Cursor describes provisioning full remote
development environments and returning screenshots, videos, and logs so a
human can validate the agent's work.[^cursor-remote-agents] The same needs
exist locally; local tools often satisfy them implicitly.

## Coding context

[Context engineering](../../foundations/system-elements-and-boundaries.md) in this domain includes more
than selecting source files. Relevant context can include:

- the task, acceptance criteria, and product intent;
- repository instructions and scoped conventions;
- architecture, domain vocabulary, and dependency structure;
- reusable workflows and repository-specific commands;
- source, tests, schemas, examples, and version history;
- the current branch, diff, task plan, and execution state;
- live application behavior and verification results;
- review comments, CI failures, and deployment evidence.

The useful unit is therefore **coding context**, not merely code context. A
source snippet may explain implementation while omitting the reason for a
change, the command that verifies it, or the operational evidence that makes
it safe to ship.

## Term boundaries

| Term | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Coding agent | The agent that reasons and acts on software work |
| Coding harness | The system around that agent for software-engineering tasks |
| Repository harness | Repository-owned environment adaptation for coding agents |
| Coding environment | The filesystem, tools, dependencies, services, and compute where work executes |
| Repository context | Information supplied or discovered from repository-local artifacts |
| Coding context | All task-relevant information, including repository, runtime, product, and feedback context |

A product name may refer to an agent, harness, host, or platform in ordinary speech.
The distinction becomes important when diagnosing failures: changing the model
will not repair a broken environment, missing repository route, stale task
state, or inadequate verification surface.

## A domain profile, not a separate discipline

Software engineering harnesses apply the general principles of
[harness engineering](../../harness/harness-engineering.md) to software
work. [Agent legibility](../../foundations/agent-legibility.md) provides one
cross-domain quality for evaluating how well source structure, application
state, tools, and evidence are exposed. Local and remote implementations should
be compared by how well they fulfill the same
responsibilities, not by whether they use the same files or infrastructure.

See [Harness classification](../../harness/harness-classification.md) for
the axes behind these profiles and the [harness engineering glossary](../../glossary.md) for the
bundle's shared terminology.
