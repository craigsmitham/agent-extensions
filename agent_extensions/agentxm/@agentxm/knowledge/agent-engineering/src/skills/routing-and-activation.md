# Routing and activation

Before activation, a host commonly exposes only a skill's name and description.
The description is therefore executable routing behavior, not catalog prose.
OpenAI and Anthropic both emphasize describing what the skill does and when it
should be used.[^openai-build-skills][^anthropic-best-practices]

## Routing contract

A useful description contains:

1. **Capability** — the outcome or job the skill performs.
2. **Positive triggers** — verbs, artifacts, file types, tools, and domain terms
   likely to appear in real requests.
3. **Negative boundary when needed** — a plausible adjacent task that would
   otherwise over-match.

Put all selection information in metadata; the body cannot repair a missed
activation because it has not loaded yet. Do not accumulate exclusions for
neighbors that are unlikely to collide: every extra clause consumes discovery
attention and can make the route less legible.

## Distinct surfaces

- Model-facing descriptions optimize selection.
- Human-facing registry descriptions optimize discovery and trust.
- Explicit invocation bypasses routing but does not prove implicit selection.
- Host invocation policy may permit, suppress, or isolate implicit loading.

## Failure classes

| Failure | Evidence | Likely correction |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Miss | Clear positive does not select the skill | Add recognizable capability or trigger language |
| False positive | Adjacent negative selects the skill | Narrow capability or add a negative boundary |
| Collision | Several skills plausibly match | Differentiate responsibility, artifacts, or lifecycle stage |
| Keyword stuffing | Description selects broadly but destination cannot fulfill it | Align metadata with actual capability |
| Explicit-only success | Manual invocation works, implicit does not | Fix routing; do not bloat the body |
