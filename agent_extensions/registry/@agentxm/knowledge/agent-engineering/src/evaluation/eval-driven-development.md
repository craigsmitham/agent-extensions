# How to practice eval-driven development

1. Name the product decision and success criteria before optimizing the target.
2. Establish a representative case set, environment, grader set, and baseline.
3. Preserve the exact target and evaluation identities.
4. Change one attributable surface where practical.
5. Run enough isolated trials to reveal decision-relevant variance.
6. Inspect raw outputs, traces, external state, surprising passes, and failures.
7. Classify target, case, environment, harness, and grader failures separately.
8. Retain a change only when intended outcomes improve without unacceptable
   regressions, cost, latency, authority, or risk.
9. Convert confirmed field failures and discoveries into regression cases.
10. Run affected cases continuously and revisit representativeness over time.

OpenAI recommends evaluating early and continuously, mining logs for cases, and
calibrating automated scoring with humans.[^openai-evals] Anthropic recommends
defining capabilities through evals early and maintaining suites as routine
product work.[^anthropic-evals]

Evaluation guides development; it does not authorize the evaluator to repair a
target during a supposedly controlled run. Separate measurement from mutation
when attribution or independent judgment matters.
