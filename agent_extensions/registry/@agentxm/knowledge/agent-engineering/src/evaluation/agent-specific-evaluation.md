# Agent-specific evaluation

Agent engineering supplies the **what**: the behaviors, risks, trajectories,
states, and deployment scenarios that must be measured. Evaluation engineering
supplies the **how**: objectives, sampling, trials, graders, baselines,
uncertainty, aggregation, validity, and lifecycle.

## Bind the target identity

Record at least the goal contract, model, prompts, tool set and permissions,
memory policy, coordination topology, autonomy classification, environment,
termination policy, and harness/runtime version. A score without these
identities cannot be attributed to the agent design.

## Evaluate more than final answers

- task outcome and external effects;
- observation and tool-selection quality;
- plan quality, unnecessary actions, and replanning;
- stopping, escalation, and budget behavior;
- recovery from tool, context, and environment failure;
- memory writes, retrieval influence, and stale or poisoned state;
- delegation, handoff, synthesis, and multi-agent consistency;
- human intervention quality and approval usability;
- safety, privacy, security, robustness, cost, and latency.

Use both outcome graders and trajectory inspection because an acceptable result
can arise through unsafe behavior, and a sensible trajectory can still fail to
produce the required effect.[^anthropic-evals] Sample realistic tasks and run
repeated trials where model or environment variance matters.[^openai-evals]

The evaluation survey literature likewise treats planning, tool use,
self-reflection, memory, cost, safety, and robustness as distinct agent
capabilities or concerns.[^eval-survey]
