# Prompt contracts

A prompt contract describes behavior that an observer can grade. Begin with the
outcome and failure conditions; do not begin by selecting a prompting technique.

## Contract fields

| Field | Required question |
| --- | --- |
| Goal | What must the response help accomplish? |
| Inputs | What will be supplied, discovered, or unavailable? |
| Definitions | Which terms, labels, and thresholds need precise meaning? |
| Constraints | What must remain true, absent, bounded, or unchanged? |
| Authority | What may the model decide, propose, inspect, or change? |
| Evidence | What support, citations, observations, or calculations are required? |
| Uncertainty | When should the response qualify, ask, abstain, or name missing evidence? |
| Output | Which content, structure, order, length, and audience are required? |
| Completion | What indicates that the interaction has fulfilled its job? |
| Non-goals | Which adjacent decisions or actions remain elsewhere? |

Use the least instruction that fully expresses the contract. OpenAI recommends
outcome-focused prompts that name the goal, relevant context, constraints,
required evidence, success criteria, and output format, while avoiding repeated
instructions.[^openai-guidance]

Define success criteria before optimizing wording. Otherwise a change can make
the output feel different without establishing that it is better.[^anthropic-overview]

Prompt authority remains communicative rather than enforceable. If violating a
boundary would create unacceptable effects, the harness must prevent the effect
instead of relying on the model to remember the instruction.
